Because Kwil database [networks](#kwil-network) are sovereign blockchains, there are a few concepts that are unique or borrowed from other blockchain platforms. These concepts are transversal across Kwil (frontends, SDKs, Nodes, etc.).

## Accounts

Accounts are public / private keypairs that represent a single user or entity on a Kwil Network. Accounts are used to deploy databases and execute CRUD operations.

Each account has an identifier (either the hex-encoded public key, or address), nonce, and balance.

Accounts are identified by public keys. Natively, Kwil supports Secp256k1 keys (used in EVM) and ED25519 keys (used in Solana, NEAR, etc).

## Databases

In Kwil, databases refer to relational database schemas on a Kwil Network. The Kwil [SQL engine](/docs/category/sql-as-understood-by-kwil) is based on SQLite with modifications to support deterministic execution and consensus.

### Kuneiform

[Kuneiform](/docs/category/kuneiform) is a simple syntax language for defining a database on Kwil. You can think of Kuneiform as a smart contract language (e.g. [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)), but for relational databases.

In a Kuneiform file, you can define:

- Relational Tables
- Actions - CRUD Operations that can be executed on the database.
- Extensions - Import additional logic that can be executed on the database.

### Database Identifiers

Database identifiers (DBIDs) are unique identifiers for a database on a [Kwil Network](#kwil-network). DBIDs are generated from database name and database owner's public key. A DBID is a SHA224 hash of the database owner's account public key and database name.

### Transactions

Transactions are database deployments, database drops, and state changing (create, update, delete) actions that are executed on a database. Transactions are signed by an account and are propagated to the Kwil Network. Transactions are executed deterministically on each node in the network and are validated by the nodes.

### View Actions

View actions are the primary way of reading data from a database. View actions are called from a single node and may or may not require signature. The advantage of view actions is that they can be executed without the need to wait for consensus.

## Kwil Network

A Kwil Network is a sovereign blockchain that is used to deploy databases and execute CRUD operations. Kwil Networks are composed of one or more [Kwil Nodes](#kwil-node). A project may have its own Kwil Network, or multiple projects may share a Kwil Network.

## Kwil Node

Kwil Nodes run the [Kwil Daemon](/docs/category/node) and are the infrastructure that power Kwil Networks. Kwil Nodes are responsible for:

- Storing the state of the Kwil Network
- Executing transactions
- Validating transactions
- Propagating transactions to other nodes
- Maintaining consensus

Each node has a public / private ED25519 keypair that is used to sign transactions and blocks. Note that the Node keypair is only for validating the blockchain, and is different from the [account](#accounts) keypair.

## Extensions

[Extensions](/docs/extensions/overview) are modules that customize the behavior of a Kwil Network. Extensions can be used to customize the cyrptographic signature used for verifying [accounts](#accounts), import libraries into [Kuneiform](#kuneiform), and implement built-in network oracles and governance rules. Extensions are written in Go and compiled with the Kwild binary.
