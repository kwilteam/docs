Indexes are database structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on database tables.
They provide faster access to data by creating a separate data structure that the database engine can search quickly.

## Types of Indexes

We support two types of btree indexes:

1. Regular btree indexes
2. Unique btree indexes

Both use the B-tree data structure for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Creating Indexes

To create an index on an existing table:

```sql
CREATE INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS] [index_name] ON table_name (column_name);
```

### Creating Unique Indexes

To create a unique index:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX [index_name] ON table_name (column_name);
```

### Multi-Column Indexes

Create indexes on multiple columns:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table_name (column1, column2, column3);
```

The order of columns is important. The index can be used for queries referencing the first column, first two columns, first three columns, and so on, in order.

## Dropping Indexes

Remove an index using:

```sql
DROP INDEX [IF EXISTS] index_name;
```

The `IF EXISTS` clause is optional and prevents an error if the index doesn't exist.
