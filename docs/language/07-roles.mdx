Roles in Kwil allow you to define privileges that can be held by users, defining how users can interact with the database.
Using roles, you can designate rules for how schemas can change, who can execute ad-hoc SQL statements, and set access control
rules for namespaces.

## Creating Roles

To create a new role, use the `CREATE ROLE` statement:

```sql
CREATE ROLE [IF NOT EXISTS] role_name;
```

To drop a role, use the `DROP ROLE` statement:

```sql
DROP ROLE [IF EXISTS] role_name;
```

There are two built-in roles in Kwil:

- `owner`: the owner is a special role that has all privileges on the database. There can only ever be one owner. Privileges cannot
be revoked from the `owner` role.
- `default`: the default role is held by all users, and cannot be revoked. By default, the `default` role can call all actions and
execute ad-hoc SELECT statements, however these privileges can be revoked.

The initial database owner is specified in a network's genesis configuration. The owner can transfer ownership to another wallet
using the `TRANSFER OWNERSHIP` statement:

```sql
TRANSFER OWNERSHIP TO 'some_wallet_address';
```

## Privileges

Kwil has a pre-defined set of privileges that can be granted to roles. All privileges can be granted globally. Some privileges can be
granted on a namespace. For example, if the `insert` privilege is granted on the `main` namespace, the role can execute ad-hoc INSERT
statements against the `main` namespace, but not into any other namespace.

Kwil supports the following privileges. If "Global-Only" is marked as "Yes", the privilege can only be granted globally. If
"Global-Only" is marked as "No", the privilege can be granted globally or on a namespace:

| Privilege | Global-Only | Description |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `SELECT` | No | Allows the role to execute ad-hoc SELECT statements. |
| `INSERT` | No | Allows the role to execute ad-hoc INSERT statements. |
| `UPDATE` | No | Allows the role to execute ad-hoc UPDATE statements. |
| `DELETE` | No | Allows the role to execute ad-hoc DELETE statements. |
| `CREATE` | No | Allows the role to create tables, actions, and other database objects. |
| `DROP` | No | Allows the role to drop tables, actions, and other database objects. |
| `ALTER` | No | Allows the role to alter tables, actions, and other database objects. |
| `CALL` | No | Allows the role to call actions. |
| `ROLES` | Yes | Allows the role to create, grant, and revoke roles. |
| `USE` | Yes | Allows the role to initialize a new extension. |

## Granting and Revoking Privileges

To grant a privilege to a role, use the `GRANT` statement:

```sql
GRANT [IF NOT GRANTED] privilege_name [, privilege_name] [ON namespace_name] TO role_name;
REVOKE [IF GRANTED] privilege_name [, privilege_name] [ON namespace_name] FROM role_name;
```

Roles can be granted to users using the same syntax:

```sql
GRANT [IF NOT GRANTED] role_name TO {'some_wallet_address' | $user_variable };
REVOKE [IF GRANTED] role_name FROM {'some_wallet_address' | $user_variable };
```

## Example

In this example, we create a new role called `editor`, and grant it the `INSERT` and `UPDATE` privileges on the `main` namespace.
We then grant the `editor` role to a user with the wallet address `0x1234`.

```sql
CREATE ROLE editor;

GRANT INSERT, UPDATE ON main TO editor;

GRANT editor TO '0x1234';
```
