This page documents the supported features for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT statements in Kwil's SQL dialect.
Kwil supports a subset of the SQL standard, with a few minor additions and changes. It is most similar to PostgreSQL.

## Top-Level Statements

A top-level statement is a standalone INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/SELECT statement that can be executed either directly against
the database, or within an action. Any top-level statement can begin with one or more common table expressions:

```sql
WITH <common_table_expression> [, <common_table_expression> ...]
<top_level_statement>
```

Common table expressions can either specify their return column names, or omit them, in which case they will be inferred:

```sql
-- Explicit column names
WITH names_above_30 (name) AS (SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 30)
...

-- Inferred column names
WITH names_above_30 AS (SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 30)
```

Common table expressions can also be made recursive using the `WITH RECURSIVE` syntax. Recursive common table expressions
specify an anchor (or base) query and a recursive query that refers to the CTE itself:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE numbers_cte AS (
    -- Base case: Start with the number 1
    SELECT 1 AS number
    UNION ALL
    -- Recursive case: Increment the number by 1 until it reaches 10
    SELECT number + 1
    FROM numbers_cte
    WHERE number < 10
)
```

## INSERT Statement

The INSERT statement allows you to add new rows to a table. It supports inserting data via literal values or from
the results of a SELECT statement. Additionally, it offers an upsert mechanism via ON CONFLICT to handle duplicate key scenarios.

### Basic Syntax
```sql
INSERT INTO <table_name> [AS <alias>] 
    [ ( <column_list> ) ]
    { 
       VALUES ( <expr1>, <expr2>, ... ) [ , ( <expr1>, <expr2>, ... ) ] 
       | <select_statement>
    }
    [ <upsert_clause> ]
```

### Upsert Clause
Kwil's SQL dialect supports an upsert mechanism, allowing you to handle conflicts arising from unique or primary key constraints. The upsert clause is specified via ON CONFLICT:

```sql
ON CONFLICT 
    [ ( <conflict_column_list> ) [ WHERE <conflict_condition> ] ]
    DO { NOTHING | UPDATE SET <column> = <expr> [ , <column> = <expr> ] [ WHERE <update_condition> ] }
```

### Insert from Select
Instead of providing literal values, you can supply a SELECT statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO target_table (col1, col2)
SELECT source_col1, source_col2 
FROM source_table
WHERE ...
```

The number of columns in the SELECT must match the number of columns in the INSERT list (or the full table definition if the list is omitted).
All rows returned by the SELECT statement are inserted.

## Examples:

#### Insert Single Row

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, username, email)
VALUES (1, 'alice', 'alice@example.com');
```
#### Insert Multiple Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, username, email)
VALUES
    (2, 'bob', 'bob@example.com'),
    (3, 'charlie', 'charlie@example.com');
```

#### Insert from Select

```sql
INSERT INTO archived_users (id, username, email)
SELECT id, username, email
FROM users
WHERE age > 65;
```

#### Upsert with DO NOTHING

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, username)
VALUES (100, 'dave')
ON CONFLICT (id) 
DO NOTHING;
```

#### Upsert with DO UPDATE

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, username)
VALUES (100, 'dave')
ON CONFLICT (id) 
DO UPDATE SET username = EXCLUDED.username;
```

## UPDATE Statement

The UPDATE statement allows you to modify existing rows in a table. It supports updating multiple columns in a single
statement, and can reference other tables in the FROM clause.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
UPDATE <table_name> [AS <alias>]  
SET <column1> = <expr1> [, <column2> = <expr2>, ...]  
[FROM <relation> [JOIN ...]]  
[WHERE <condition>]  
```

### Example

```sql
UPDATE users AS u
SET name = 'Alice', age = 30
FROM roles r
INNER JOIN user_roles ur ON ur.role_id = r.id
WHERE u.id = ur.user_id 
  AND r.name = 'admin';
```

## DELETE Statement

The DELETE statement allows you to remove rows from a table. It supports filtering rows using a WHERE clause.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM <table_name> [AS <alias>]
[WHERE <condition>]
```

### Example

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE age < 18;
```

## SELECT Statement

The SELECT statement allows you to query data from one or more tables. It supports features
like filtering, grouping, ordering, joins, and window functions.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT [DISTINCT] <result_columns>  
FROM <table_name> [AS <alias>]
[JOIN <table_name> ON <join_condition> ...]
[WHERE <condition>]
[GROUP BY <group_by_columns> [HAVING <condition>]]  
[WINDOW <window_name> AS [<window_specification>] [,...]]
[ { UNION [ALL] | INTERSECT | EXCEPT } <select_statement> ]
[ORDER BY <ordering_columns> [ASC|DESC] [NULLS FIRST|LAST]]  
[LIMIT <row_count>]  
[OFFSET <offset_count>];
```

### Examples

#### Using a Group By

```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM events
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY user_id ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

#### Using a Window Function

```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id) AS total
FROM events
ORDER BY user_id ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

#### Using Recursive a CTE

```sql
with recursive r as (
	select 1 as n
	union all
	select n+1 from r where n < 6
)
select * from r;
```
