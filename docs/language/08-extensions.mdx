Extensions in Kwil allow you to extend the language with new features. This can be as simple as adding new functions, or as complex
as bridging tokens from a blockchain into your database. This guide does not cover how to implement extensions, but rather how to use them.
To learn how to implement extensions, see the Extensions Guide.

## Using Extensions

To use an extension, use the `USE` statement. The `USE` statement references the extension's name (defined in the extension's implementation),
and can optionally pass a set of options. The extension can then be aliased to a name, which can be used to reference this specific instance
of the extension. **The `USE` statement will create a namespace of the same name as the alias.**

```sql
USE extension_name [{
    option_name: option_value,
    ...
}] AS alias;
```

Similarly, you can use the `UNUSE` statement to remove the extension:

```sql
UNUSE alias;
```

For example, if we are using a hypothetical extension `hashing`, we might use it like this:

```sql
USE hashing {
    algorithm: "sha256"
    ...
} AS sha256;
```

This will create a namespace called `sha256` that contains the extension's functions. Any methods defined on the extension
can now be called within an action. Let's assume that the `hashing` extension has a method `hash` that hashes a string:

```sql
CREATE ACTION use_hashing() public {
    $hash = sha256.hash("hello world");
}
```

Extension methods _cannot_ be called within SQL statements. They can only be called within an action's body. For example, **the following
action is invalid:**

```sql
CREATE ACTION use_hashing() public {
    -- this will fail, because the extension method cannot be called in a SQL statement
    SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = sha256.hash("hello world");
}
```

Instead, you must call the extension method within an action:

```sql
CREATE ACTION use_hashing() public {
    $hash = sha256.hash("hello world");
    SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = $hash;
}
```
