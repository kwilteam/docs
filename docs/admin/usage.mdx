`kwil-admin` provides several functions for node setup and administration that
are accessible through sub-commands.

To show `kwil-admin` usage and all of the available top level commands, provide
the `-h` or `--help` flag:

```
$ kwil-admin -h
kwil-admin: The Kwil node admin tool

kwil-admin version 0.5.1
Usage: kwil-admin <command> [<args>]

Options:
  --help, -h             display this help and exit
  --version              display version and exit

Commands:
  key
  setup
  validators
  node
  help
  version
```

With the exception of `help` and `version`, each of the commands must be used
with a sub-command. For example, to list the `key` sub-commands:

```
$ ./kwil-admin key -h
kwil-admin: The Kwil node admin tool

kwil-admin version 0.5.1
Usage: kwil-admin key <command> [<args>]
  --help, -h             display this help and exit
  --version              display version and exit

Commands:
  info                   Display info about a node private key.
  gen                    Generate a node private key.
```

To see usage of the `key info` sub command:

```
$ ./kwil-admin key info -h
kwil-admin: The Kwil node admin tool

kwil-admin version 0.5.1
Usage: kwil-admin key info [--key-file KEY-FILE] [PRIVKEY]

Positional arguments:
  PRIVKEY                Private key (hexadecimal string)

Options:
  --key-file KEY-FILE, -k KEY-FILE
                         file containing the private key
  --help, -h             display this help and exit
  --version              display version and exit
```

The following sections will describe each of the commands provided by
`kwil-admin`, but always reference the syntax and full set of options shown by
appending the `-h` (or `--help`) flag to the full command in question.
