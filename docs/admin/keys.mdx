The `key` command provides subcommands for private key generation
and inspection. These are the private keys that identify the node on the network
and provide validator transaction signing capability.

## Generation

To generate a node private key, the basic syntax is:

```
kwil-admin key gen [--key-file KEY-FILE]
```

The square brackets around the `--key-file` flag indicate that it is optional.
If you specify a file name, the generated key will be written to that file,
otherwise it will be printed to stdout with additional information. The written
file is suitable for use as `kwild` private key file.

## Key Information

To display information on a private key:

```
kwil-admin key info [--key-file KEY-FILE] [PRIVKEY]
```

This will read the key from a file or as a positional argument (hexadecimal
string). If providing the key on the command line, be aware of the security
implications, and prefer the `--key-file` argument when possible.

For example, using a test key generated with the `kwil-admin key gen --key-file=./testkey` command:

```
$ kwil-admin key info --key-file ./testkey

```

The derived address and public key may be required to configure a new genesis
configuration for a private network with this nodes as an initial validator. The
various public key formats and the node ID are also helpful when interpreting
node logs.
