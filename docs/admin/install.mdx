description: How to install the Kwil admin tool
slug: /admin/installation
---

Until the main Kwil DB repository is open source, the `kwil-admin` command line
application may be (a) used from within the Kwil Docker image or (b) downloaded
from the `kwil-cli` binary release repository.

## From within the Kwil Docker image

To install the most recent Kwil image, run:

```sh
docker pull kwildb/kwil:latest
```

With a running container (e.g. `docker container run kwild:latest`), open an
interactive shell in the container where you can run `kwil-admin` commands:

```sh
docker exec -it <container-name-or-id> /bin/sh
```

**DRAFT NOTE: this only works with the "shell" variant of the docker image, which is ~35MiB larger than the scratch one.  Maybe we make that standard?**

## Download the standalone `kwil-admin` executable

Both the Kwil user CLI (`kwil-cli`) and the node administration tool will be
packaged together for convenience. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-cli/releases)
for your platform.  Extract the `kwil-admin` file from the archive and put it
into a folder that is in your `PATH` environment.

**DRAFT NOTE: we haven't actually bundled it with the kwil-cli downloads either**

## Verify Installation

Open a terminal and run the following at the command prompt:

```sh
kwil-admin version
```

If installed correctly, it should display a message such as `kwil-admin version 0.5.1`.

Continue to the [Usage page](./usage) for a description of all the available commands.
