## kwil-cli query

Execute a SELECT statement against the database

### Synopsis

Execute a SELECT statement against the database.

This command executes a SELECT statement against the database and formats the results in a table.
It can only be used to execute SELECT statements, and cannot be used with any other type of SQL statement.
If you need to execute a SQL statement that modifies the database, use the 'exec-sql' command.

It is not required to have a private key configured, unless the RPC you are calling is in private mode, or
you are talking to Kwil Gateway.
