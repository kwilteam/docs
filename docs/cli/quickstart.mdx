This guide outlines the basic usage of the Kwil CLI for configuring a private key, provider, chain ID, and deploying a database. It will also demonstrate how to execute an action and call a view action.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have downloaded and installed `kwil-cli` onto your system. Refer to the installation guide for detailed instructions.

## Configuration

### Persistent Configuration

Configure the Kwil CLI with a persistent global setting using the command below, which will prompt you for the necessary configurations:

```bash
kwil-cli configure
```

Your configuration file will be stored at `~/.kwil-cli/config.json`.

### Global Flags

For temporary use, you can override persistent configurations by using global flags like so:

```bash
kwil-cli --provider=http://your.kwil.provider:port --private-key=your_private_key --chain-id=your_chain_id
```

Global flags take precedence over persistent configs.

## Deploying a Database

To deploy a database, you need to have a file containing the database schema in Kuneiform or JSON format:

```bash
kwil-cli database deploy ./path_to_schema_file.kf
```

## Executing a Procedure/Action

Execute an action or procedure against a database by providing the action/procedure name and parameters.

```bash
kwil-cli database execute procedure_name parameter_1:value_1 parameter_2:value_2 --dbid target_dbid
```

## Calling a View Procedure/Action

Call a view (read-only) procedure on a database using the following command:

```bash
kwil-cli database call view_procedure_name parameter_1:value_1 --dbid target_dbid
```

## Note

Remember to replace placeholders such as `your.kwil.provider:port`, `your_private_key`, `your_chain_id`,  `path_to_schema_file`, `target_dbid`, `procedure_name`, `parameter:value`, and `view_procedure_name` with actual values based on your database and setup.

For a more detailed usage of each command, refer to the appropriate section of the Kwil CLI reference guide.
