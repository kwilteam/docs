This guide outlines the basic usage of the Kwil CLI for configuring a private key, provider, chain ID, and deploying a database. It will also demonstrate how to execute an action and call a view action.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have downloaded and installed `kwil-cli` onto your system. Refer to the installation guide for detailed instructions.

## Configuration

### Persistent Configuration

Configure the Kwil CLI with a persistent global setting using the command below, which will prompt you for the necessary configurations:

```bash
kwil-cli configure
```

Your configuration file will be stored at `~/.kwil-cli/config.json`.

### Global Flags

For temporary use, you can override persistent configurations by using global flags like so:

```bash
kwil-cli --provider=http://your.kwil.provider:port --private-key=your_private_key --chain-id=your_chain_id
```

Global flags take precedence over persistent configs.

## Executing SQL

To execute a raw SQL statement (e.g. to create a table), use the `kwil-cli exec-sql` command:

```bash
kwil-cli exec-sql --sql "CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, age INT NOT NULL, address TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE)"
```

:::note
The `exec-sql` command is only for executing SQL statements that are modifying state, and can not be used to read data.
:::

## Executing an Action

Execute an action against a database by providing the action name and parameters. For example, if we have an action called
`create_user`, and it takes parameters of `username` (of type text) and `age` (of type int8), you can execute it like so:

```bash
kwil-cli exec-action create_user text:satoshi int8:32
```

## Reading Data with a SELECT Statement

To execute a SELECT statement on a database, use the `kwil-cli query` command:

```bash
kwil-cli query --sql "SELECT * FROM users"
```

## Reading Data with a View Action

To call a view (read-only) action on a database, use the `kwil-cli call-action` command. For example, if we have a view action called `get_user`,
and it takes a parameter of `username` (of type text), you can call it like so:

```bash
kwil-cli call-action get_user text:satoshi
```
