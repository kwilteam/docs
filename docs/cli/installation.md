Until the main Kwil DB repository is open source, the `kwil-cli` command line
application may be downloaded from the Kwil binary release repository.


## Download the `kwil-cli` Executable

The Kwil Cli (`kwil-cli`) will be packaged together with Kwil Daemon (`kwild`) and Kwil Admin Tool (`kwil-admin`).
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/kwilteam/binary-releases/releases/latest)
for your platform.  Extract the `kwil-cli` file from the archive and put it
into a folder that is in your `PATH` environment.


## Verify Installation

Open a terminal and run the following at the command prompt:

```bash
kwil-cli version
```

If installed correctly, it should display the version info match your downloaded version.

Continue to the [Configuration](./configuration) page to setup.
