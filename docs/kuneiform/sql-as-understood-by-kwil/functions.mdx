:::info
Most of these functions are direct copies of PostgreSQL functions, and further documentation can be found in the
[PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/functions.html). Functions that are not direct translations from Postgres
will have a * next to them.

All parameters with a `?` are optional.
:::

## Mathematical Functions

`abs(INT|DECIMAL) -> INT|DECIMAL`

Returns the absolute value of the given integer.

## UUID Functions

`uuid_generate_v5(UUID, TEXT) -> UUID`

Generates a deterministic UUID from the given namespace and text value. Namespaces guarantee uniqueness of the generated
UUID, even if the same input value is used elsewhere. Namespaces should be hardcoded as follows: `uuid_generate_v5('455f60aa-0569-4aaa-8469-63be2ec4dd96'::uuid, 'hello')`

## Encoding Functions

`encode(BLOB, TEXT) -> TEXT`

Encodes a binary string into a text string. Supported formats are `base64`, `hex`, and `escape`.

---

`decode(TEXT, TEXT) -> BLOB`

Decodes a text string into a binary string. Supported formats are `base64`, `hex`, and `escape`.

## Digest Functions

`digest(TEXT|BLOB, TEXT) -> BLOB`

Computes a hash of the given input string using the specified algorithm. Supported algorithms are
`md5`, `sha1`, `sha224`, `sha256`, `sha384`, and `sha512`.

## Array Functions

`array_append(any[], any) -> any[]`

Appends a value to the end of an array.

---

`array_prepend(any, any[]) -> any[]`

Prepends a value to the beginning of an array.

---

`array_cat(any[], any[]) -> any[]`

Concatenates two arrays together.

---

`array_length(any[]) -> INT`*

Returns the length of the array. This does not directly match Postgres's `array_length` function, which takes a second argument
specifying the dimension to return the length of. Kwil only supports 1-dimensional arrays.

## String Functions

`bit_length(TEXT) -> INT`

Returns the number of bits in the given string.

---

`char_length(TEXT) -> INT`

`character_length(TEXT) -> INT`

`length(TEXT) -> INT`

Returns the number of characters in the given string.

---

`lower(TEXT) -> TEXT`

Lowercases the given string.

---

`lpad(TEXT, INT, TEXT?) -> TEXT`

Expands the given string (first argument) to the given length (second argument) by adding the padding string (third argument) to the left.
If the padding string is not provided, it defaults to a space.

---

`ltrim(TEXT, TEXT?) -> TEXT`

Removes the longest string from the first argument that contains only characters in the second argument from the left.
If the second argument is not provided, it defaults to a space.

---

`octet_length(TEXT) -> INT`

Returns the number of bytes in the given string.

---

`overlay(TEXT, TEXT, INT, INT?) -> TEXT`*

Overlays the second argument on top of the first argument, starting at the given position (third argument) and replacing the given number of characters (fourth argument).
If the fourth argument is not provided, it defaults to the length of the second argument.

This does not directly match Postgres's syntax, which uses `overlay(string placing string from int [for int])`, however it does
directly match Postgres's `overlay` functionality.

---

`position(TEXT, TEXT) -> INT`*

Returns the position of the second argument in the first argument.

This does not directly match Postgres's syntax, which uses `position(substring in string)`, however it does
directly match Postgres's `position` functionality.

---

`rpad(TEXT, INT, TEXT?) -> TEXT`

Expands the given string (first argument) to the given length (second argument) by adding the padding string
(third argument) to the right. If the padding string is not provided, it defaults to a space.

---

`rtrim(TEXT, TEXT?) -> TEXT`

Removes the longest string from the first argument that contains only characters in the second argument from the right.
If the second argument is not provided, it defaults to a space.

---

`substring(TEXT, INT, INT?) -> TEXT`*

Returns a substring of the given string starting at the given position (second argument) and optionally ending at the given position
(third argument). If the third argument is not provided, it defaults to the end of the string.

This does not directly match Postgres's syntax, which uses `substring(string [from int] [for int])`, where either `from` or `for` is optional.
Kwil requires `from` to be implicitly specified as the second parameter, and `for` to be the (optional) third parameter. To omit
the `from` parameter in Kwil, use `substring(string, 1, for)`. Kwil does not support the usage of regular expressions in `substring`,
as Postgres does.

---

`trim(TEXT, TEXT?) -> TEXT`*

Removes the longest string from the first argument that contains only characters in the second argument from
the start and end of the string. If the second argument is not provided, it defaults to a space.

This does not directly match Postgres's syntax, which allows for the specification of the trim direction (leading, trailing, or both).
To trim only the start or end, use `ltrim` or `rtrim` respectively.

---

`upper(TEXT) -> TEXT`

Uppercases the given string.

---

`format(TEXT, ...any) -> TEXT`

Formats the given string with the given arguments. It uses the same syntax as `sprintf` in C.

## Aggregate Functions

`count(*) -> INT`

Returns the number of rows in the current group.

---

`sum(INT|DECIMAL|UINT256) -> INT|DECIMAL|UINT256`

Returns the sum of all values in the current group.

## Misc Functions

`error(TEXT) -> none`*

Error raises an exception with the given message. It halt execution when it is called,
and rollback any changes made in the current transaction.
