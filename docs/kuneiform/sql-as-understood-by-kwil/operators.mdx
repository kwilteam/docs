The below table shows order of operations for all operators, from highest to lowest precedence. This generally matches
[Postgres's operator precedence](<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.2/sql-precedence.html>), albeit with a restricted
set of operators.

| `()` | | Parentheses |
| `::` | Left | Type Cast |
| `[]` | Left | Array Index |
| `.` | Left | Member Access |
| `-` | Right | Negation |
| `*`, `/`, `%` | Left | Multiplication, Division, Modulo |
| `+`, `-` | Left | Addition, Subtraction |
| `IS` |  | Type Comparison |
| `IN` |  | Set Membership |
| `BETWEEN` |  | Range Comparison |
| `LIKE`, `ILIKE` |  | Pattern Matching |
| `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` |  | Comparison |
| `==`, `!=`, `=`, `:=` | Right | Equal, Not Equal, SQL Assignment, Procedure Assignment |
| `NOT` | Right | Logical NOT |
| `AND` | Left | Logical AND |
