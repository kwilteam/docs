## Supported Arithmetic Operators

<table class="custom-table">

|Operator|Description|
|:------:|:---------:|
| + (Addition) | Adds values on either side of the operator | 
| - (Subtraction) | Subtracts the right hand operand from the left hand operand |
| * (Multiplication) | Multiplies values on either side of the operator | 
| / (Division) | Divides the left hand operand by the right hand operand | 
| % (Modulus) | Divides the left hand operand by the right hand operand and returns the remainder | 

</table>

## Supported Comparison Operator

|Operator|Description|
|:------:|:---------:|
| == | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then the condition becomes true. | 
| = | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then the condition becomes true. | 
| != | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true. | 
| &lt;&gt; |	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true. | 
| > | Checks if the values of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, if yes then the condition becomes true. | 
| < | Checks if the values of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, if yes then the condition becomes true. | 
| >= | Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes then the condition becomes true. | 
| <= | Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes then the condition becomes true. | 
| IS | The IS operator is used in SQL to compare a value against NULL. It is used with the NULL keyword to check if a value is NULL. For example, column_name IS NULL would return true if the value in column_name is NULL. |
| IS NOT | The IS NOT operator is used to check if a value is not NULL. For example, column_name IS NOT NULL would return true if the value in column_name is not NULL. |
| IN | The IN operator is used to check if a value matches any value in a list or a subquery. For example, column_name IN (value1, value2, ...) |
| NOT IN | The NOT IN operator is used to check if a value does not match any value in a list or subquery. For example, column_name NOT IN (value1, value2, ...). |

## Supported Logical Operators

|Operator|Description|
|:------:|:---------:|
| AND | The AND operator allows the existence of multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause. |
| OR | The OR operator is used to combine multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause. |

## Supported String Operators

|Operator|Description|
|:------:|:---------:|
| LIKE | For pattern matching against a specific column or string. The pattern can include wildcard characters like % (matches any sequence of characters) and _ (matches any single character). |
| NOT LIKE | Select the rows that do not match the specified LIKE pattern. |
| GLOB | Similar to LIKE, but it uses a different wildcard pattern matching syntax. In a GLOB pattern, * matches any sequence of characters, and ? matches any single character. |
| NOT GLOB | Select the rows that do not match the specified GLOB pattern. |
| REGEXP | Regular expressions define a search pattern using special characters and quantifiers to match specific patterns in the data. |
| NOT REGEXP | Select the rows that do not match the specified regular expression pattern. |
| MATCH | Select the rows that match the specified full-text search query. |
| NOT MATCH | Select the rows that do not match the specified full-text search query. |

## Supported Bitwise Operators

|Operator|Description|
|:------:|:---------:|
| & | And |
| \| | OR |
| ~ | Not |
| << | Left Shift |
| >> | Right Shift |

## Supported Unary Operators

|Operator|Description|
|:------:|:---------:|
| + (Unary Plus) | The unary plus operator simply returns the value of the operand as is. |
| - (Unary Minus) | The unary minus operator negates the value of the operand. |
| ~ (Bitwise NOT) | The bitwise NOT operator performs a bitwise negation on the operand, flipping each bit. |
| NOT (Logical NOT) | The logical NOT operator returns the boolean opposite of the operand. It is used to negate a boolean value. |

## Operator Precedence Table
|Precedence|Operators<sup>1</sup>|
|:--------:|:-------------------:|
| 1 | ~ [expr] &nbsp; &nbsp; + [expr] &nbsp; &nbsp; - [expr] |
| 2 | [expr] COLLATE (collation-name)<sup>2</sup> |
| 3 |  \|\| &nbsp; &nbsp; -> &nbsp; &nbsp; ->> |
| 4 | * &nbsp; &nbsp; / &nbsp; &nbsp; % |
| 5 | + &nbsp; &nbsp; - |
| 6 | & &nbsp; &nbsp; \| &nbsp; &nbsp; << &nbsp; &nbsp; >> |
| 7 | [expr] ESCAPE [escape-character-expr]<sup>3</sup> |
| 8 | < &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; > &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <= &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; >= |
| 9 | = &nbsp; &nbsp; == &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; != &nbsp; &nbsp; IS &nbsp; &nbsp; IS NOT <br/> IS DISTINCT FROM &nbsp; &nbsp; IS NOT DISTINCT FROM <br/> [expr] BETWEEN<sup>4</sup> [expr] AND [expr] <br/> IN<sup>4</sup> &nbsp; &nbsp; MATCH<sup>4</sup> &nbsp; &nbsp; LIKE<sup>4</sup> &nbsp; &nbsp; REGEXP<sup>4</sup> &nbsp; &nbsp; GLOB<sup>4</sup>  <br/> [expr] ISNULL &nbsp; &nbsp; [expr] NOTNULL &nbsp; &nbsp; [expr] NOT NULL|
| 10 | NOT [expr] |
| 11 | AND |
| 12 | OR |

1. "[expr]" denotes operand locations for non-binary operators. Operators with no "[expr]" adjunct are binary and left-associative.
2. The COLLATE clause (with its collation-name) acts as a single postfix operator.
3. The ESCAPE clause (with its escape character) acts as a single postfix operator. It can only bind to a preceding [expr] LIKE [expr] expression.
4. Each keyword in (BETWEEN IN GLOB LIKE MATCH REGEXP) may be prefixed by NOT, retaining the bare operator's precedence and associativity.
