Kuneiform supports a number of advanced features that provide powerful and flexible functionality for your Kwil database.
Developers should use these features with caution, as they can introduce complexity and potential security risks.

## Actions

Actions are similar to procedures, in that they are used to execute SQL statements. Unlike procedures, actions are not strongly typed,
and cannot include business logic. Actions can only be used to call extensions, call other procedures/actions, or execute SQL.
Actions are primarily used to call [precompiles](/docs/extensions/precompiles), which are built-in functions that are specific
to each Kwil network. **Actions cannot be called by procedures.**

:::tip
Unless you are using precompiles, you should use procedures instead of actions, as procedures are
safer and more efficient.
:::

```typescript
action update_user ($username, $age) public {
    // execute a SQL statement
    UPDATE users
    SET username=$username, age=$age
    WHERE address=@caller;
}
```

Actions can use the same [access modifiers](/docs/kuneiform/procedures#access-modifiers) and
[contextual variables](/docs/kuneiform/introduction#contextual-variables) as procedures.

## Extensions (Precompiles)

Extensions are network-specific functions that network deployers can build into their Kwil binaries. They are capable
of containing any arbitrary business logic. They can only be called by actions, and **cannot** be called by procedures.
To learn how to create your own custom extension, see the [Extensions](/docs/extensions/precompiles) documentation.

To initialize an extension, use the `use` block. Below, we initialize and call and extension called `hash`.
The extension has the method `digest`, and can be initialized with the desired algorithm.
This is a hypothetical extension, and is not a real precompile.

```typescript
database mydb;

use hash {
    algorithm: 'sha256'
} as hash;

action select_data() public view {
    $hash_value = hash.digest('my_data');

    select $hash_value::text;
}
```

## Calling Other Actions

Actions can call other actions and procedures. They cannot handle return data from procedures, but they can call them.
Below, we have an action that calls an action `do_something`.

```typescript
action do_something() private {
    // do something
}

action update_user_age($id uuid) public {
    do_something($id);
    // ...
}
```

Actions cannot directly call procedures or built-in functions, but can call them in SQL statements:

```typescript
procedure multiply($a int, $b int) public view returns (product int) {
    return $a * $b;
}

action update_user_age($id uuid) public {
    // call a procedure in a SQL statement
    select abs(age), multiply(age, 3) from users;
}
```
