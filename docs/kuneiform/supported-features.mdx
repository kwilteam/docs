## Data Types

Kwil supports a restricted set of data types compared to other relational databases.  If there is a data type your application would like to see added, please let us know!  Below is a list of currently supported data types:

| Data Type | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `int` | A 64-bit integer |
| `text` | A string of text |
| `blob` | A binary set of data |

## Attributes

Attributes refer to a the properties and constraints of a column.  A column can have multiple attributes.  Some attributes require values to be defined with them.  Below is a list of supported attributes:

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `primary_key` | The column is the primary key of the table.  A table can only have one primary key. |
| `unique` | The column must have a unique value for each row. |
| `not_null` | The column cannot be null. |
| `default` | The column will have a default value if no value is provided. |
| `min` | The column must be greater than or equal to the value provided. |
| `max` | The column must be less than or equal to the value provided. |
| `min_length` | The column must have a text length greater than or equal to the value provided. |
| `max_length` | The column must have a text length less than or equal to the value provided. |

## Indexes

Kwil supports the following index types defined at the `table` level:

| Index Declaration | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| index(`<column-name-1>`, `<coloumn-name-2>`, ...) | Standard binary tree index |
| unique(`<column-name-1>`, `<coloumn-name-2>`, ...) | Creates a binary tree index while enforcing the unique attribute on the specified columns |
| primary(`<column-name-1>`, `<coloumn-name-2>`, ...) | Creates a binary tree index while enforcing the primary key values of the specified columns |

## Access Tags

Access tags are used to control access to actions.  They are defined in the `action` signature.  All actions must specify `public` or `private`, and can additionally
specify other tags.  Below is a list of supported tags:

| Tag | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `public` | The action is public and can be called by any wallet or action. |
| `private` | The action is private and can only be from within other actions. |
| `owner` | The action can only be called by the dataset deployer. |
| `view` | The action can be called without modifying state.  This allows the action to be called synchronously, enabling an action to return data. |
| `mustsign` | A `view` action must still contain a valid signature from the caller.  This is useful for querying data that needs to use `@caller` in the query, or (in the case of private networks) requires some sort of authentication for access control. |
