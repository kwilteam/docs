Kuneiform is a language for defining databases on Kwil.  While we typically refer to an entire schema file as a "Kuneiform" file, schema files are technically made of two distinct languages:

- **Kuneiform (DDL):** The Kuneiform language is specifically a Data Defintion Language (DDL) for Kwil databases.  DDL's typically manage structuring metadata; a common example is the `CREATE TABLE ...` statement in typical SQL databases.  Kuneiform is a more "modern" version of this, featuring a C-like syntax, as well as new features.

- **SQL (DML):** In Kwil, regular SQL is used as the Data Manipulation Language (DML).  SQL is written within a Kuneiform file to store, update, or retrieve data.  While Kwil uses it's own SQL standard for security purposes, it is most similar to the SQL-92 standard.  For most users, it can be thought of as a slightly restrictive version of SQLite's syntax.

You can write, compile, and deploy Kuneiform, as well as view sample Kuneiform files, online at https://ide.kwil.com.

```typescript title="social_network.kf"
database social_network;

// table for storing users
// each wallet can have a user
table users {
    id int primary notnull,
    username text notnull unique minlen(5) maxlen(32),
    age int notnull max(150),
    address text notnull unique // wallet address
}

// a public action for creating a user
// it will store the user's wallet address
action create_user ($id, $username, $age) public {
    INSERT INTO users
    VALUES ($id, $username, $age, address(@caller));
}

// a public action for updating a user's own mutable data
action update_user ($username, $age) public {
    UPDATE users
    SET username=$username, age=$age
    WHERE address=address(@caller);
}
```
