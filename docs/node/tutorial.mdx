description: Create a Kwil network, and add another node as a validator
slug: /node/tutorial
---

This tutorial will demonstrate how to create a local Kwil network on the same machine.

In this tutorial, we will:

1. Create a node and start a new network;
2. Create a second node and configure it to join the network;
3. Add the second node to the network as a non-validating peer;
4. Upgrade the second node to a validator.
5. Deploy a database to the network.

:::tip
In order to do this tutorial, you will need to [install the `kwild` and `kwil-admin` binaries](<https://github.com/kwilteam/binary-releases/releases>).

## Creating The First Node

### Creating The Node's Files

To create the node's configuration files, a new `genesis.json`, and a new keypair, we will use the `kwil-admin` tool:

```bash
kwil-admin setup init -o ./testnet/node0
```

### Running The Node

Using the `kwild` binary, we can begin running the network with this single node:

```bash
kwild --root-dir ./testnet/node0 --app.admin-listen-addr unix:///tmp/node0.sock
```

The command then runs the local Kwil network, and begins producing blocks.

:::tip
The `--app.admin-listen-addr` flag is used to specify the UNIX socket that the admin RPC server will listen on. This is used to communicate with the node using the `kwil-admin` tool.

By default the admin RPC server listens on `unix:///tmp/kwil_admin.sock`. This tutorial uses a different socket to avoid conflicts when running multiple nodes on the same machine (multiple nodes cannot use the same socket).
:::

### Getting The Node's Info

In order to allow other nodes to join, we will need to expose our node's information publicly. Other operators can then set us as a peer,
and request to join the network as a validator.

To get our node's information, we can use the `kwil-admin` tool, specifying the UNIX socket that our admin RPC is listening on:

```bash
$ kwil-admin node status --rpcserver unix:///tmp/node0.sock
{
  "node": {
    "chain_id": "kwil-chain-WfnGxpWd",
    "name": "MacBook-Pro-7.local",
    # highlight-next-line
    "node_id": "b624b3395f22f8cb57cf86d58cbcd6b355d12e18", # node ID
    "proto_ver": 8,
    "app_ver": 0,
    "block_ver": 11,
    # highlight-next-line
    "listen_addr": "tcp://0.0.0.0:26656", # p2p address
    "rpc_addr": "tcp://127.0.0.1:26657"
  },
  "sync": {
    "app_hash": "",
    "best_block_hash": "",
    "best_block_height": 0,
    "best_block_time": "1969-12-31T18:00:00-06:00",
    "syncing": false
  },
  "validator": {
    "pubkey": "22cbbb666c26b2c1f42502df72c32de4d521138a1a2c96121d417a2f341a759c",
    "power": 1
  }
}
```

The `node.node_id` and `node.listen_addr` fields can be given to the second node as a persistent peer, in the format: `node-id@p2p-address`.
For the above node, we would have `b624b3395f22f8cb57cf86d58cbcd6b355d12e18@127.0.0.1:26656`.  We change `0.0.0.0` to an IP address that the second node can reach: `127.0.0.1`.

## Creating A Second Peer Node

Using the `kwil-admin` tool to create the second node's directories and configs, we can specify where to find the genesis file and any
peers that it should try to connect to when starting up. Since both nodes are running locally, we need to specify
new addresses for the different endpoints, so that the second node does not conflict with the first node:

**Ensure that you replace `b624b3395f22f8cb57cf86d58cbcd6b355d12e18` with your own node's ID.**

```bash
kwil-admin setup peer --root-dir ./testnet/node1 --genesis ./testnet/node0/genesis.json \
--chain.p2p.persistent-peers b624b3395f22f8cb57cf86d58cbcd6b355d12e18@127.0.0.1:26656 \
--app.grpc-listen-addr=localhost:50052 --app.http-listen-addr=localhost:8081 \
--app.admin-listen-addr=unix:///tmp/node1.sock --chain.rpc.listen-addr=tcp://127.0.0.1:26658 \
--chain.p2p.listen-addr=tcp://127.0.0.1:26655
```

Start the second node to verify that it was created correctly:

```bash
kwild --root-dir=./testnet/node1
```

If done correctly, you should be able to see the second node's logs, and it should be able to read the network logs.

## Upgrading The Second Node To A Validator

To upgrade the second node to a validator, we will use the `kwil-admin` tool to:

1. Request to join the network as a validator, from the second node
2. Approve the request, from the first node

We will use the configured UNIX socket to communicate with the nodes.

### Requesting To Upgrade

To request to join from the second node:

```bash
kwil-admin validators join --rpcserver unix:///tmp/node1.sock
```

To check that the request was successful, we can get a list of pending join requests:

```bash
$ kwil-admin validators list-join-requests --rpcserver unix:///tmp/node0.sock
Pending join requests (1 approval needed):
 Candidate                                                         | Power | Approvals | Expiration
-------------------------------------------------------------------+-------+-----------+------------
 a2d8e307117695c8d0d3adbda136cb2ad630c43b8672a0eba46d79501831b794  |     1 |         0 | 16728
```

### Approving The Request

The first node must vote to approve the second node's join request. Using the `kwil_admin` tool, the first node can
vote to approve the second node by running the `kwil-admin validators approve` command and passing the second node's public key:

```bash
kwil-admin validators approve a2d8e307117695c8d0d3adbda136cb2ad630c43b8672a0eba46d79501831b794 \
--rpcserver unix:///tmp/node0.sock
```

:::tip
If the requesting node's public key is unknown, all pending requests and their public keys can be retrieved with the `kwil-admin validators list-join-requests` command.
:::

The second node should now be a validator on the network.  To verify this, we can use the `kwil-admin` tool to get the list of validators:

```bash
$ kwil-admin validators list-validators --rpcserver unix:///tmp/node0.sock
Current validator set:
  0. {pubkey = 22cbbb666c26b2c1f42502df72c32de4d521138a1a2c96121d417a2f341a759c, power = 1}
  1. {pubkey = a2d8e307117695c8d0d3adbda136cb2ad630c43b8672a0eba46d79501831b794, power = 1}
```

## Deploying A Database

To deploy a database to the network, we will need to locate the network chain ID and any of the node's HTTP listen addresses.

### Getting The Chain ID

Get the chain ID from the node0 `genesis.json` file:

```bash
$ grep chain_id ./testnet/node0/genesis.json
  "chain_id": "kwil-chain-...",
```

### Getting The Node's HTTP Listen Address

A node's HTTP listen address can be found in its `config.toml` file. To retrieve:

```bash
$ grep http_listen_addr  ./testnet/node0/config.toml
http_listen_addr = "localhost:8080"
```

### Deploying The Database

With the chain ID and the node's HTTP listen address, we can use the `kwil-cli` to deploy a database to the network. 

**Make sure that you have a [Kuneiform file](/docs/kuneiform/introduction) to deploy.**

**Replace the `./path/to/kuneiform.kf` with the path to your Kuneiform file and the `--chain-id` and `--kwil-provider` flags with your chain ID and node's HTTP listen address:**

```bash
$ kwil-cli database deploy -p ./path/to/kuneiform.kf --chain-id kwil-chain-WfnGxpWd --kwil-provider http://localhost:8080
# Output
TxHash: 94f44a8d1acbf88523e9a222a3a6a9d3e989bac282effa38379d9f36f62a5e76
```

And that is it! Assuming the transaction was successful, the database should now be deployed to the network. You can query each node's HTTP listen address to verify that the database was deployed correctly and has been propagated to the network.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have:

1. Created a node and started a network;
2. Created a second node and configured it to join the network;
3. Added the second node to the network as a non-validating peer;
4. Upgraded the second node to a validator.
5. Deployed a database to the network.
