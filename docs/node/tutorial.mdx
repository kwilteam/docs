description: Create a Kwil network, and add another node as a validator
slug: /node/tutorial
---

In this tutorial, we will:
1. Create a node and start a new network;
2. Create a second node and configure it to join the network;
3. Add the second node to the network as a non-validating peer;
4. Upgrade the second node to a validator.

:::tip
In order to do this tutorial, you will need to [install the `kwild` and `kwil-admin` binaries](<https://github.com/kwilteam/binary-releases/releases>).
:::

## Creating The First Node

### Creating The Node's Files

To create the node's configuration files, a new `genesis.json`, and a new keypair, we will use the `kwil-admin` tool:

```bash
kwil-admin setup init -o ./testnet/node0
```

### Running The Node

Using the `kwild` binary, we can begun running the network with this single node:

```bash
kwild --root-dir ./testnet/node0 --app.admin-listen-addr unix:///tmp/node0.sock
```

The command then runs the local Kwil network, and begins producing blocks.

### Getting The Node's Info

In order to allow other nodes to join, we will need to expose our node's information publicly. Other operators can then set us as a peer,
and request to join the network as a validator.

To get our node's information, we can use the `kwil-admin` tool, specifying the UNIX socket that our admin RPC is listening on:

```bash
$ kwil-admin node status --rpcserver unix:///tmp/node0.sock
{
  "node": {
    "chain_id": "kwil-chain-WfnGxpWd",
    "name": "MacBook-Pro-7.local",
    # highlight-next-line
    "node_id": "b624b3395f22f8cb57cf86d58cbcd6b355d12e18", # node ID
    "proto_ver": 8,
    "app_ver": 0,
    "block_ver": 11,
    # highlight-next-line
    "listen_addr": "tcp://0.0.0.0:26656", # p2p address
    "rpc_addr": "tcp://127.0.0.1:26657"
  },
  "sync": {
    "app_hash": "",
    "best_block_hash": "",
    "best_block_height": 0,
    "best_block_time": "1969-12-31T18:00:00-06:00",
    "syncing": false
  },
  "validator": {
    "pubkey": "22cbbb666c26b2c1f42502df72c32de4d521138a1a2c96121d417a2f341a759c",
    "power": 1
  }
}
```

The `node.node_id` and `node.listen_addr` fields can be given to the second node as a persistent peer, in the format: `node-id@p2p-address`.
For the above node, we would have `b624b3395f22f8cb57cf86d58cbcd6b355d12e18@127.0.0.1:26656`.  We change `0.0.0.0` to an IP address that the second node can reach: `127.0.0.1`.

## Creating A Second Peer Node

Using the `kwil-admin` tool to create the second node's directories and configs, we can specify where to find the genesis file and any
peers that it should try to connect to when starting up. Since both nodes are running locally, we need to specify
new addresses for the different endpoints, so that the second node does not conflict with the first node:

**Ensure that you replace `b624b3395f22f8cb57cf86d58cbcd6b355d12e18` with your own node's ID.**

```bash
kwil-admin setup peer --root-dir ./testnet/node1 --genesis ./testnet/node0/genesis.json \
--chain.p2p.persistent-peers b624b3395f22f8cb57cf86d58cbcd6b355d12e18@127.0.0.1:26656 \
--app.grpc-listen-addr=localhost:50052 --app.http-listen-addr=localhost:8081 \
--app.admin-listen-addr=unix:///tmp/node1.sock --chain.rpc.listen-addr=tcp://127.0.0.1:26658 \
--chain.p2p.listen-addr=tcp://127.0.0.1:26655
```

Start the second node to verify that it was created correctly:

```bash
kwild --root-dir=./testnet/node1
```

If done correctly, you should be able to see the second node's logs, and it should be able to read the network logs.

## Upgrading The Second Node To A Validator

To upgrade the second node to a validator, we will use the `kwil-admin` tool to:
1. Request to join the network as a validator, from the second node
2. Approve the request, from the first node

We will use the configured UNIX socket to communicate with the nodes.

### Requesting To Upgrade

To request to join from the second node:

```bash
kwil-admin validators join --rpcserver unix:///tmp/node1.sock
```

To check that the request was successful, we can get a list of pending join requests:

```bash
$ kwil-admin validators list-join-requests --rpcserver unix:///tmp/node0.sock
Pending join requests (1 approval needed):
 Candidate                                                         | Power | Approvals | Expiration
-------------------------------------------------------------------+-------+-----------+------------
 a2d8e307117695c8d0d3adbda136cb2ad630c43b8672a0eba46d79501831b794  |     1 |         0 | 16728
```

### Approving The Request

The first node must vote to approve the second node's join request. Using the `kwil_admin` tool, the first node can
vote to approve the second node by running the `kwil-admin validators approve` command and passing the second node's public key:

```bash
kwil-admin validators approve a2d8e307117695c8d0d3adbda136cb2ad630c43b8672a0eba46d79501831b794 \
--rpcserver unix:///tmp/node0.sock
```

:::tip
If the requesting node's public key is unknown, all pending requests and their public keys can be retrieved with the `kwil-admin validators list-join-requests` command.
:::

And that's it! The second node should now be a validator on the network.  To verify this, we can use the `kwil-admin` tool to get the list of validators:

```bash
$ kwil-admin validators list-validators --rpcserver unix:///tmp/node0.sock
Current validator set:
  0. {pubkey = 22cbbb666c26b2c1f42502df72c32de4d521138a1a2c96121d417a2f341a759c, power = 1}
  1. {pubkey = a2d8e307117695c8d0d3adbda136cb2ad630c43b8672a0eba46d79501831b794, power = 1}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have:
1. Created a node and started a network;
2. Created a second node and configured it to join the network;
3. Added the second node to the network as a non-validating peer;
4. Upgraded the second node to a validator.
