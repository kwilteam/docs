description: Create a Kwil network, and add another node as a validator
slug: /node/tutorial
---

In this tutorial, we will:

1. Create a node and start a new network;
2. Create a second node and configure it to join the network;
3. Add the second node to the network as a non-validating peer;
4. Upgrade the second node to a validator.

:::tip
In order to do this tutorial, you will need to [install the `kwild` binary](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/releases),
as well as have [`docker`](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>) installed.
:::

## Creating The First Node

### Creating The Node's Files

To create the node's configuration files, a new `genesis.json`, and a new keypair, we will use the `kwild setup` command:

```shell
kwild setup init --root ./testnet/node0 --db-owner <YOUR_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS>
```

The `./testnet/node0` folder will be the "root" directory for `kwild` that
contains the configuration files, including `genesis.json` and `config.toml`.

### Running The Node

To run the first node, we will need to start a properly configured PostgreSQL instance. We will use a default pre-configured image provided by
Kwil. For information on how this can be configured manually, see the node's [PostgreSQL configuration](/docs/daemon/installation#postgresql-configuration) section.
Once the PostgreSQL instance is running, we can start the node using the `kwild` binary:

```shell
# Run Postgres
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name kwil-postgres -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" \
  kwildb/postgres:latest

# Run the node
kwild start --root ./testnet/node0 --admin.listen /tmp/node0.sock --db.port 5432
```

The command then runs the local Kwil network, and begins producing blocks.

:::note
We override the default `admin.listen` because in this tutorial, we will be running two nodes on the same machine.
To allow us to interact with both nodes' admin RPCs, we will make them listen on different UNIX sockets.
:::

### Getting The Node's Info

In order to allow other nodes to join, we will need to expose our node's information publicly. Other operators can then set us as a peer,
and request to join the network as a validator.

To get our node's information, we can use the `kwild node` tool, specifying the UNIX socket that our admin RPC is listening on:

```shell
$ kwild admin status --rpcserver /tmp/node0.sock
{
  "node": {
    "chain_id": "kwil-test-chain",
    # highlight-next-line
    "node_id": "02e804dfd8e28cbd791fd3439149b909e5300d7b7cc6cbd0e94e2178e7ed21e120#secp256k1", # node ID
    "app_ver": 1,
    # highlight-next-line
    "listen_addr": "127.0.0.1:6600", # p2p address
    "role": "leader",
    "rpc_addr": "/tmp/kwild.socket"
  },
  "sync": {
    "app_hash": "2d8f3ceeff2c836527da823d7b654d33d3e44b6159b172235c160001e0c9b4db",
    "best_block_hash": "3e044fb509b9e55c70f127ccae7884916a668ea389b71ee88a088cf172dd46a9",
    "best_block_height": 1,
    "best_block_time": "2025-01-27T11:28:02.336-06:00",
    "syncing": false
  },
  "validator": {
    "pubkey": "02e804dfd8e28cbd791fd3439149b909e5300d7b7cc6cbd0e94e2178e7ed21e120",
    "type": "secp256k1",
    "power": 1
  }
}
```

The `node.node_id` and `node.listen_addr` fields can be given to the second node as a persistent peer, in the format: `node-id@p2p-address`.
For the above node, we would have `02e804dfd8e28cbd791fd3439149b909e5300d7b7cc6cbd0e94e2178e7ed21e120#secp256k1@127.0.0.1:26656`.

## Creating A Second Peer Node

Using `kwild` to create the second node's directories and configs, we can specify where to find the genesis file and any
peers that it should try to connect to when starting up. Since both nodes are running locally, we need to specify
new addresses for the different endpoints, so that the second node does not conflict with the first node:

**Ensure that you replace `02e804dfd8e28cbd791fd3439149b909e5300d7b7cc6cbd0e94e2178e7ed21e120` with your own node's ID.**

```shell
kwild setup init --root ./testnet/node1 --genesis ./testnet/node0/genesis.json \
  --p2p.bootnodes 02e804dfd8e28cbd791fd3439149b909e5300d7b7cc6cbd0e94e2178e7ed21e120#secp256k1@127.0.0.1:6600 \
  --rpc.listen=localhost:8485 --admin.listen=/tmp/node1.sock \
  --p2p.listen=127.0.0.1:6601
```

Start the second node to verify that it was created correctly:

```shell
# Run Postgres
docker run -d -p 5431:5432 --name kwil-postgres-1 -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" \
  kwildb/postgres:latest

# Run the node
kwild start --root=./testnet/node1 --db.port 5431
```

If done correctly, you should be able to see the second node's logs, and it should be able to read the network logs.

## Upgrading The Second Node To A Validator

To upgrade the second node to a validator, we will use the `kwild validators` command to:

1. Request to join the network as a validator, from the second node
2. Approve the request, from the first node

We will use the configured UNIX socket to communicate with the nodes.

### Requesting To Upgrade

To request to join from the second node:

```shell
kwild validators join --rpcserver /tmp/node1.sock
```

To check that the request was successful, we can get a list of pending join requests:

```shell
$ kwild validators list-join-requests --rpcserver /tmp/node0.sock
Pending join requests (1 approval needed):
|                                   Candidate                                    | Power | Approvals |          Expiration           |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------+-----------+-------------------------------+
| '0385480e6c66e9c98e05a4d7dd597a096058b918a0bac4e337c25363be649e484b#secp256k1' |     1 |         0 | 2025-01-28 14:42:10 -0600 CST |
```
<>{/* (this line is not seen by users) The Candidate is usually not wrapped in quotes, but doing so formats it nicer in Docusaurus*/}</>

### Approving The Request

The first node can vote to approve the second node by running the `kwild validators approve` command and passing the second node's public key:

```shell
kwild validators approve <node_pubkey> \
  --rpcserver /tmp/node0.sock
```

:::tip
If the requesting node's public key is unknown, all pending requests and their public keys can be retrieved with the `kwild validators list-join-requests` command.
:::

And that's it! The second node should now be a validator on the network.  To verify this, we can use `kwild validators list` to get the list of validators:

```shell
$ kwild validators list --rpcserver /tmp/node0.sock
|                                   Identifier                                   | Power |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------+
| '02e804dfd8e28cbd791fd3439149b909e5300d7b7cc6cbd0e94e2178e7ed21e120#secp256k1' |     1 |
| '0385480e6c66e9c98e05a4d7dd597a096058b918a0bac4e337c25363be649e484b#secp256k1' |     1 |
```

## Cleanup

If you wish to reset this tutorial, you will need to stop the nodes and Postgres containers, remove the `testnet` directory, and remove the Postgres container:

```shell
# Stop the nodes using Ctrl+C

# Stop the Postgres containers
docker stop kwil-postgres
docker stop kwil-postgres-1

# Remove the Postgres containers
docker rm kwil-postgres
docker rm kwil-postgres-1

# Remove the testnet directory
rm -rf ./testnet
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have:

1. Created a node and started a network;
2. Created a second node and configured it to join the network;
3. Added the second node to the network as a non-validating peer;
4. Upgraded the second node to a validator.
