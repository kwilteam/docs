The `node` command is used to control a running Kwil node via its authenticated
RPC service.

The subcommands share the following syntax:

```
kwil-admin node [--rpcserver RPCSERVER] [--authrpc-cert AUTHRPC-CERT]
  [--tlskey TLSKEY] [--tlscert TLSCERT] <command> [<args>]
```

## Setup

:::warning
The assumption is that the user of `kwil-admin` is the node
operator. Access must not be granted to untrusted parties.
:::

There are two ways that `kwil-admin` may communicate with a running node:
- Via a local UNIX socket
- Via a remote TCP connection

The local UNIX socket is the default, and requires no additional setup. The
remote TCP connection requires additional setup, but is more flexible.

### TCP Setup

When using TCP, communication between `kwil-admin` and `kwild` is both encrypted and
mutually-authenticated. Each side has their own key pair, where the node's is
used to encrypt the communications, and the client's is used to authenticate
itself with the node. Thus, setup involves generating client credentials, and
setting them as an authorized RPC client on the node.

Use of the `node` commands requires the following:

- The node's TLS (encrypted transport) certificate, specified with
  `--authrpc-cert`. The default is "kwild.cert". This would be retrieved from
  the node where it is located at `~/.kwild/rpc.cert` by default.
- RPC client credentials. This is a key pair used to authenticate `kwil-admin`
  (the client) with `kwild` (the server).  The key and certificate parts are
  specified by `--tlskey` and `--tlscert`.
- Adding the client certificate to the node's allowed clients, which is locate
  on the node machine as `~/.kwild/clients.pem` by default.
- Configure the Kwil node's `admin_listen_addr` so the service is accessible to
  `kwil-admin`. See [Kwil Node Configuration](/docs/category/configuration) for more
  information.

The `kwild` process may be running locally, on a remote host, or inside a Docker
container. Set and expose the admin RPC service ports as required.

:::note
Rapidly evolving procedures here. This is all likely to change soon.

Described below are two ways to generate and set client credentials.

### Generation of Credentials on the Node

The node will generate its own TLS key and certificate, which is used encrypt
the communications on its authenticated RPC server. If the `--autogen` flag is
provided, the node will also generate new *client* credentials on start up if
the file `~/.kwild/clients.pem` does not exist. The corresponding
`auth.{cert,key}` files may then be used by the operator with `kwil-admin node`
commands for remote access to the node.

:::note
This approach is intended for "quickstart" workflows. The following method using
`kwil-admin` for generation is preferred.
:::

## Generation of Credentials by `kwil-admin`

The `kwil-admin node gen-auth-key` command may be used to generate new
credentials to `~/.kwil-admin/auth.{cert,key}`.

With this method, the contents of the `auth.cert` file must be appended to the
node's `clients.pem` file. Specifically,

1. Generate credentials with `kwil-admin node gen-auth-key`
2. Securely copy the `~/.kwil-admin/auth.cert` file to the machine where `kwild`
   is running, if it is not the same host.
3. Append the contents of the copied `auth.cert` to the node's `clients.pem` file.

  ```bash
  cat auth.cert >> ~/.kwild/clients.pem
  ```

If `kwil-admin` is being used on the same machine as `kwild`, you would skip the
copy step and do:

```bash
cat ~/.kwil-admin/auth.cert >> ~/.kwild/clients.pem
```
