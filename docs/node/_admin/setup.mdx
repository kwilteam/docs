The `setup` command provides functions for creating and managing node
configuration and data, including:

* performing quick setup of a standalone Kwil node (`init`) and Kwil test networks (`testnet`)
* updating genesis config a hash of the initial database state (`genesis-hash`)
* resetting node state and all data files (`reset`)

## Quick Setup of a Single Kwil Node

The `init` command facilitates quick setup of an isolated Kwil node on a fresh
network in which that node is the single validator.  This permits rapid
prototyping and evaluation of Kwil DB functionality.

For example, to create a node configuration for a new network in a node root
folder at `~/.kwild-new`:

```
$ kwil-admin setup init --root-dir ~/.kwild-new
Initialized node in /home/user/.kwild-new
```

The above command also generated a new `config.toml` and `private_key` file in
the node directory.

Additional nodes may join this new network by specifying the existing node as a
persistent peer in `kwild`'s configuration and in the validators section of the
genesis configuration. See [Kwil Daemon Configuration](/docs/category/configuration) for
more information on node setup.

## Creating a New Test Network of Several Nodes

The `setup testnet` command is used to create multiple node configurations, all
with the same genesis config, and pre-configured to connect to each other. This
command has several options:

```
kwil-admin setup testnet [--validators V] [--non-validators N] [--config FILE]
  [--output-dir DIR] [--node-dir-prefix PRE] [--hostname-prefix PRE]
  [--hostname-suffix SUF] [--starting-ip IP] [--hostnames HOSTNAMES] [--p2p-port PORT]
```

There are defaults for each flag, with the output writing to a folder called
`.testnet` in the current folder.  For example, the following command creates a
new test network with 8 total nodes comprising 4 validators and 4 non-validators:

```
$ kwil-admin setup testnet -o ~/.kwild-testnet-xyz
Successfully initialized 3 node directories: /home/jon/.kwild-testnet-xyz

$ tree ~/.kwild-testnet-xyz
/home/user/.kwild-testnet-xyz
├── node0
│   ├── abci
│   │   ├── config
│   │   │   └── genesis.json
│   │   └── data
│   ├── config.toml
│   └── private_key
├── node1
│   ├── abci
│   │   ├── config
│   │   │   └── genesis.json
...
```

The config files for each of the nodes will specify all of the other nodes as
persistent peers so that they will connect to each other on startup. This is
generally only practical for small test networks with fewer than 12 nodes.

For more information on usage, configurations, and more, use the `--help` flag:

```
kwil-admin setup testnet --help
```

## Updating Genesis Config with Initial Postgres Data

If preparing a network with initial databases, it is required to update the "app
hash" in `kwild`'s genesis configuration to reflect the initial state of a Postgres database. The syntax is:

```
kwil-admin setup genesis-hash [--genesis GENESIS] [--root-dir ROOTDIR] [--snapshot SNAPSHOT] \
  [--dbname DBNAME] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--user USER] [--password PASSWORD]
```

Both inputs are optional, using default paths. `GENESIS` is the path to the
genesis file to patch, which is `~/.kwild/abci/config/genesis.json` by default.
The `ROOTDIR` argument is the root directory of a node, which is `~/.kwild` by
default. Alternatively, configurations for a Postgres connection can be provided,
or a path to a snapshot file can be specified.
Use the `--help` flag for more information.

## Resetting All Application Data

To delete all of a Kwil node's data files, use the `reset` command.

**WARNING: This command should not be used on production systems. This should
only be used to reset disposable test nodes.**

```
kwil-admin setup reset [--root-dir DIR] [--force] [--dbname DBNAME] [--host HOST] \
  [--port PORT] [--user USER] [--password PASSWORD]
```

This command only requires one: (a) `--root-dir` to specify a node root
directory containing the files to reset, or (b) `--force` to automatically reset
the files in the default node root directory at `~/.kwild`.

Extra Postgres configurations can be provided if needed, but the command will attempt
to connect using the configurations in the `config.toml` file in the node root.
