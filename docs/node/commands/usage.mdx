`kwild` provides several functions for node setup and administration that
are accessible through sub-commands.

Running `kwild` with no arguments or the `--help`/`-h` flag will display the available commands.

Many commands contain sub-commands. For example, to list the `key` sub-commands:

```
$ kwild key
The 'key' command provides subcommands for private key generation and inspection. These are the
private keys that identify the node on the network and provide validator transaction signing
capability.

Usage:
  kwild key [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate a private key for validator use.
  info        Display information about a private key.

Flags:
  -h, --help            help for key
      --output string   the format for command output - either 'text' or 'json' (default "text")

Global Flags:
  -r, --root string   root directory (default "/home/user/.kwild")

Use "kwild key [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

To see usage of the `key info` sub command:

```
$ kwild key info -h
Display information about a private key.

The private key can either be passed as a key file path, or as a hex-encoded string.

Usage:
  kwild key info [flags]

Examples:
# Using a key file
kwild key info --key-file ~/.kwild/nodekey.json

# Using a hex-encoded string
kwild key info 381d28cf348c9efbf7d26ea54b647e2cb646d3b98cdeec0f1053a5ff599a036a0aa381bd4aad1670a39977d5416bfac7bd060765adc58a4bb16bbbafeefbae34

Flags:
  -h, --help              help for info
  -o, --key-file string   file containing the private key to display

Global Flags:
      --output string   the format for command output - either 'text' or 'json' (default "text")
  -r, --root string     root directory (default "/home/user/.kwild")
```

The following sections will describe each of the commands provided by
`kwild`. Always reference the syntax and full set of options shown by
appending the `-h` (or `--help`) flag to the full command in question.
