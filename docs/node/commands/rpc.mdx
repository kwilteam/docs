description: Controlling a running node on the authenticated RPC service
slug: /admin/node
---

The `admin` command is used to control a running Kwil node via its authenticated
RPC service.

The subcommands share the following syntax:

```
kwild admin [--rpcserver RPCSERVER] [--pass ADMIN-PASS] [--authrpc-cert AUTHRPC-CERT]
  [--tlskey TLSKEY] [--tlscert TLSCERT]  <command> [<args>]
```

## Setup

There are multiple ways that `kwild admin` may communicate with a running node:

- UNIX socket (local file path)
- TCP on a loopback interface (local access)
- TCP on a routable address with TLS (for remote access)

A local UNIX socket is the default, and requires no additional setup. A
loopback TCP interfaces (e.g. 127.0.0.1) also requires no additional setup,
but requires additional system security measures and/or password protection.
Finally, a routable TCP address requires TLS setup, which is detailed below.

:::warning Restrict access to the admin service

The assumption is that the user of `kwild admin` is the node
operator. Access must not be granted to untrusted parties.

:::

The relevant settings in `config.toml` are in the `[admin]` section:

```toml
# Admin RPC service configuration
[admin]
# enable the admin RPC service
enable = true
# address in host:port format or UNIX socket path on which the admin RPC server will listen
listen = '/tmp/kwild.socket'
# optional password for the admin service
pass = ''
# disable TLS when the listen address is not a loopback IP or UNIX socket
notls = false
```

With the service enabled and the `listen` address set, the service should be
secured appropriately. The following sections describe the remaining settings.

### TLS

When `kwild`'s admin service is configured with a routable TCP address, or if
the listen address is prefixed with `https://`, TLS is automatically enabled to
secure communications. A TLS key and certificate for the node's admin RPC
service are automatically generated when the node is initialized.  This may be overridden with the `notls` setting.

When the server has TLS enabled, the RPC client used by the `kwild admin`
commands must use the node's TLS certificate to authenticate the server on
connection, regardless of the client authentication method used, which are
described in the following sections. When run from the same host as the node,
the client will automatically attempt to use the node's TLS certificate from
`kwild`'s root directory. If it is not accessible, or if the `kwild admin`
command is run from a different host, the command must specify the path to the
node's TLS certificate with `--authrpc-cert`. The certificate is found in the
node's root directory as `admin.cert`.

### Password Authentication

Any type of listen address (UNIX, loopback TCP, or remote TCP) may be combined
with a password to control access. The password is set with the `admin.pass` setting.

:::warning
When combining password authentication with a routable TCP address, a secure transport is required.
:::

With a password set, the `kwild admin` command must be run with the `--pass` flag.

### Mutual TLS Authentication

The most secure method of authentication is mutual TLS (mTLS), whereby TLS
authentication is performed by both the client and the server. Typically, TLS is
only used for encryption and to authenticate the server to the client; with
mTLS, the server authenticates the client in the the TLS handshake as well.

Setup of mTLS is more complex as each side has their own key pair, where the
client's is used to authenticate itself with the node. Thus, setup involves
generating credentials for the RPC client used by the `kwild admin` command, and
setting them as an authorized RPC client on the node.

Use of the `admin` command with mTLS requires the following:

- The node's TLS (encrypted transport) certificate, specified with
  `--authrpc-cert`. For remote access, this would be retrieved from the node
  where it is located at `~/.kwild/admin.cert`.
- Client credentials. This is a key pair used to authenticate the `kwild admin`
  client with the RPC server on the running node.  The key and
  certificate parts are specified to the command with the
  `--tlskey` and `--tlscert` flags.
- Adding the client certificate to the node's list of allowed clients, which is
  located on the node machine as `~/.kwild/clients.pem`.

Described below are two ways to generate and set client credentials.

#### Generation of Credentials on the Node

If the `--autogen` flag is provided, the node will generate new *client*
credentials on start up if the file `~/.kwild/clients.pem` does not exist. The
generated `adminclient.{cert,key}` files may then be used with `kwild admin`
commands for remote access to the node.

:::note
This approach is intended for "quickstart" workflows. The following
method using the `kwild admin gen-auth-key` command for generation is preferred.
:::

#### Generation of Credentials with `gen-auth-key`

The `kwild admin gen-auth-key` command may be used to generate new client credentials.

If `kwild admin` is being used on the same machine as the running node, it
automatically adds the generated key to the list of authorized clients in the
`clients.pem` file. Otherwise, the contents of the genereated `adminclient.cert`
file must be appended to the node's `clients.pem` file. i.e. `cat adminclient.cert >> ~/.kwild/clients.pem`. Either way requires restarting the node.
