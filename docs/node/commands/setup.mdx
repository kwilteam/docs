The `setup` command provides functions for creating and managing node
configuration and data, including:

* performing quick setup of a standalone Kwil node (`init`) and Kwil test networks (`testnet`)
* resetting node state and all data files (`reset`)
* generating just a new genesis file (`genesis`)

<>{/* updating genesis config a hash of the initial database state (`genesis-hash`)*/}</>

## Quick Setup of a Single Kwil Node

The `init` command facilitates quick setup of an isolated Kwil node on a fresh
network in which that node is the single validator.  This permits rapid
prototyping and evaluation of Kwil DB functionality.

For example, to create a node configuration for a new network in a node root
folder at `~/.kwild-new`:

```
$ kwild setup init --root ~/.kwild-new
Kwil node configuration generated at /home/jon/.kwild-new
```

The above command generates new `config.toml`, `genesis.json`. and
`nodekey.json` files in the node's root directory.

Additional nodes may join this new network by specifying the existing node as a
bootstrap peer in `kwild`'s configuration, and using the same `genesis.json`
file. See [Kwil Daemon Configuration](/docs/category/configuration) for more
information on node setup.

## Creating a New Test Network of Several Nodes

The `setup testnet` command is used to create multiple node configurations, all
with the same genesis config, and pre-configured to connect to each other. This
command has several options:

```
kwild setup testnet [--vals/-v V] [--non-vals/-n N] [--out-dir DIR]
  [--port/-p PORT] [--unique-ports/-u] [--db-owner OWNER]
```

There are defaults for each flag, with the output writing to a folder called
`.testnet` in the current folder.  For example, the following command creates a
new test network with 3 total nodes, all of which are validators:

```
$ kwild s setup testnet -o ~/.kwild-testnet-xyz
Generated testnet configuration in .kwild-testnet-xyz

$ tree ~/.kwild-testnet-xyz
/home/user/.kwild-testnet-xyz
├── node0
│   ├── config.toml
│   ├── genesis.json
│   └── nodekey.json
├── node1
│   ├── config.toml
│   ├── genesis.json
│   └── nodekey.json
└── node2
    ├── config.toml
    ├── genesis.json
    └── nodekey.json
```

The config files for each of the nodes will specify all of the other nodes as
persistent peers so that they will connect to each other on startup. This is
generally only practical for small test networks with fewer than 12 nodes.

For more information on usage, configurations, and more, use the `--help` flag:

```
kwild setup testnet --help
```

## Resetting All Application Data

To delete all of a Kwil node's data files, use the `reset` command.

**WARNING: This command should not be used on production systems. This should
only be used to reset disposable test nodes.**

```
kwild setup reset [--root DIR] [--force] [--dbname DBNAME] [--host HOST] \
  [--port PORT] [--user USER] [--password PASSWORD]
```

This command only requires one: (a) `--root` to specify a node root
directory containing the files to reset, or (b) `--force` to automatically reset
the files in the default node root directory at `~/.kwild`.

Extra Postgres configurations can be provided if needed, but the command will attempt
to connect using the configurations in the `config.toml` file in the node root.

## Generating a Genesis File

A less common operation provided by the `setup genesis` command is the ability
to generate a new genesis file without creating a root directory (as with `setup init`)
or multiple root directories for a testnet (as with `setup testnet`). This is of use in the following case:

1. When you already have a node private key and config file and want to create a genesis file for a new network. This scenario is described in the [Production Guide](/docs/node/production#creating-the-genesis-document).
2. When you want to prepare a genesis file to provide to the `setup init` command with the `--genesis` flag, as when preparing for a network migration, as described in the [Migration Tutorial](/docs/node/migrations/zero-downtime-migrations/tutorial#setting-up-the-new-nodes).

Please see the above links for more information on this command.
