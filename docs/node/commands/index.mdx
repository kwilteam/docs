The `kwild` application provides several commands for a node operator that
provide the following functionality:

1. Quick test network configuration.
2. Node key generation.
3. Interaction with a running `kwild` process via the node's authenticated admin RPC interface.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
