A new node joining the network needs to catchup with the existing nodes to be able to participate in the network. The default approach the node uses to catch up with the network is to replay all the blocks from the genesis. This process can take a long time depending on the number of blocks in the chain. Statesync is a feature that allows a new node to bootstrap directly from a snapshot instead of replaying all the blocks from the genesis. This greatly reduces the time it takes to sync a new node to the network, but the node will have a truncated history starting from the height of the snapshot.

:::note
Statesync is not attempted on a partially synced node. If you have a partially synced node, it uses blocksync by default to sync the remaining blocks.

## Trusted Snapshot Providers

To support statesync, each network should have atleast two trusted snapshot providers that are responsible for creating, distributing and validating snapshots. These trusted snapshot providers should have [snapshot creation](/docs/daemon/config/settings#appsnapshots) enabled and these provider's chain P2P and RPC endpoints should be accessible to the other nodes in the network to respond to the snapshot discovery and validation requests from the new nodes.

Along with the trusted snapshot providers, other nodes in the network can also enable snapshots and distribute them to the joining nodes during the statesync process. However, a joining node only accepts these snapshots after validating them with the trusted snapshot providers.

### Enabling Snapshot Creation
Snapshots can be enabled on the Kwil nodes by providing the following configuration in the `config.toml` file. Refer to the [snapshot](/docs/daemon/config/settings#appsnapshots) configuration for more details.

```toml
[app.snapshots]

# Enables snapshots
enabled = true

# Path to the snapshots directory
snapshot_dir = "snapshots"

# (Multiples of) Heights at which the database is snapshotted.
recurring_height = 10000

# Maximum number of snapshots to store on disk
max_snapshots = 3
```

If snapshots are enabled, node starts to generate snapshots at every block height that is a multiple of `recurring_height`. The snapshots generated are stored on the disk at the location specified using the `snapshot_dir` configuration. These snapshots are the logical sql dumps of the underlying Postgres database, compressed and divided into chunks of 16MB each. 


## Configuring Statesync

The new node joining the network can be configured to use statesync by providing the following configuration in the `config.toml` file.

```yaml
[chain.statesync]
# State sync rapidly bootstraps a new node by discovering, fetching, and restoring the database
# snapshot from peers instead of fetching and replaying historical blocks. Requires some peers in
# the network to take and serve snapshots. State sync is not attempted if the node
# has any local state (LastBlockHeight > 0). The node will have a truncated block history,
# starting from the height of the snapshot.
enable = true

# Path to the directory where the received snapshot is stored
snapshot_dir = "rcvd_snaps"

# Trusted snapshot providers (comma-separated chain RPC servers) are the source-of-truth for the snapshot integrity.
# Snapshots are accepted for statesync only after verifying it with these trusted snapshot providers.
# Atleast 1 trusted rpc server is required for enabling state sync.
rpc_servers = "http://rpc1:26657,http://rpc2:26657"

# Time to spend discovering snapshots before initiating a restore. (default: 15 seconds)
discovery_time = "15s"

# The timeout duration before re-requesting a chunk, possibly from a different
# peer (default: 1 minute), if the current peer is unresponsive to the chunk request.
chunk_request_timeout = "10s"

# Note: If the requested chunk is not received within 2 minutes (hard-coded default), 
# the state sync process is aborted and the node will fall back to the regular block sync process.
```

When state sync is enabled, the node first discovers snapshots from all its connected peers. It then selects the latest snapshot from those discovered and validates the integrity of the snapshot with the trusted snapshot provider. Once a valid snapshot is identified, the node fetches the snapshot chunks from the peers and restores the database state using these chunks. The node then begins syncing blocks starting from the snapshot height.

:::note
The node will stay in the discovery phase until a snapshot is discovered and validated. If there are no snapshots in the network, the node will be stuck in the discovery phase. To make progess, restart the node by disabling statesync to switch to using blocksync.
