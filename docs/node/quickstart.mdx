This page demonstrates Kwil DB in both single node and multi-node configurations
using new randomly generated chains and validator keys. Use this to evaluate and
test `kwild`. To prepare a production deployment, see
[Installation](/docs/daemon/installation) and [Running a Kwil Node](/docs/daemon/kwild)

## Installation

To run either a single Kwil node, or a network of nodes, you will need to download the binaries.  Kwil releases
binaries on [Github](<https://github.com/kwilteam/binary-releases/releases>).

Kwil also requires a dedicate PostgreSQL host configured for `kwild`.

See the [Installation](/docs/daemon/installation) page for details.

## Single Node

First ensure that PostgreSQL is running and configured for `kwild`. See
[Installation](/docs/daemon/installation) for details. For the quickstart, just:

```bash
docker run -p 5432:5432 -v kwil-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data --shm-size 256m \
    -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" kwildb/postgres:latest
```

To run a single node, simply use the `kwild` binary with the `--autogen` flag.
This will automatically generate a genesis file, private key, and more in the
`~/.kwild` directory.

```bash
kwild --autogen
```

:::note
The `--autogen` flag generates a random chain ID, which is the network's identity, as well as a new initial validator private key.
The node will be the one initial validator.
As such, this mode is primarily useful for a quick deployment for evaluation and testing; production networks will define their own chain ID and initial validator set.
:::

To clean up when done testing, delete the `~/.kwild` folder and the
`kwil-pgdata` Docker volume.

## Multi-Node

To run a local Kwil network, you can use the `kwil-admin` tool to generate multiple node configs.

### Generate Configs

To generate the configs for 3 validators in `./kwil-testnet`, run:

```bash
kwil-admin setup testnet -v 3 --hostnames "localhost,localhost,localhost" --output-dir ./kwil-testnet
```

This creates three nodes that can run on the same host for evaluation.
A production network would comprise nodes on different machines, but with the same `genesis.json` file.

### Run Nodes

First start `postgres` containers for each of the nodes. Use the following
commands to start all three running in the background, with different named
volumes, and listening on ports 5440-5442.

```bash
docker run -p 5440:5432 -v kwil0-testnet-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data --shm-size 256m \
    -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" --name node0 -d kwildb/postgres:latest
docker run -p 5441:5432 -v kwil1-testnet-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data --shm-size 256m \
    -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" --name node1 -d kwildb/postgres:latest
docker run -p 5442:5432 -v kwil2-testnet-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data --shm-size 256m \
    -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" --name node2 -d kwildb/postgres:latest
```

:::tip
Use `docker container ls` to check the `postgres` container status. When done testing
`kwild`, use `docker container rm -f node0 node1 node2` and
`docker volume rm kwil0-testnet-pgdata kwil1-testnet-pgdata kwil2-testnet-pgdata`
to stop and delete them.
:::

To run the nodes, we can use the `kwild` binary in 3 separate terminals.  We will need to specify the `--root_dir` flag to
point to the directory where the node config is located.

```bash title="Terminal 1"
kwild --root-dir ./kwil-testnet/node0 --app.pg-db-port 5440
```

```bash title="Terminal 2"
kwild --root-dir ./kwil-testnet/node1 --app.pg-db-port 5441
```

```bash title="Terminal 3"
kwild --root-dir ./kwil-testnet/node2 --app.pg-db-port 5442
```

Once the nodes are running, they will begin mining blocks.  You can now connect to their gRPC and HTTP
endpoints to interact with your local network.

## For Developers

Given a clone of the source code repository and development tooling, there are
other automated options for starting nodes for testing in the
[README](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/blob/main/README.md). In
particular, a Docker Compose service is defined in `deployments/compose/kwil`
that automatically starts containers for both a single node with `--autogen` and
a separate container for `postgres`. For a multi-node development environment,
the command `task dev:testnet:up` will start several nodes in a network
configuration.
