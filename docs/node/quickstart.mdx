This page demonstrates Kwil DB in both single node and multi-node configurations
using new randomly generated chains and validator keys. Use this to evaluate and
test `kwild`. To prepare a production deployment, see
[Installation](/docs/daemon/installation), and either [Running a Kwil Node](/docs/daemon/kwild)
or the [Production Deployment guide](/docs/node/production).

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Docker](<https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>)
- [`kwild`](<https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/releases>)
- An Ethereum address that can be designated as the database's owner

## Installation

To run either a single Kwil node, or a network of nodes, you will need to download the `kwild` binary.  Kwil releases
binaries on [Github](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/releases).

Kwil also requires a dedicated PostgreSQL host configured for `kwild`.

See the [Installation](/docs/daemon/installation) page for details.

## Single Node

### Start

First ensure that PostgreSQL is running and configured for `kwild`. For the quickstart, just:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name kwil-postgres -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" \
    kwildb/postgres:latest
```

To run a single node, simply use the `kwild` binary with the `--autogen` flag.
This will automatically generate a genesis file, private key, and more in the
`~/.kwild` directory.

```bash
kwild start --autogen --db-owner <YOUR_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS>
```

:::note
The `--autogen` flag generates a random chain ID, which is the network's identity, as well as a new initial validator private key.
The node will be the one initial validator.
As such, this mode is primarily useful for a quick deployment for evaluation and testing; production networks will define their own chain ID and initial validator set.
:::

### Cleanup

To clean up when done testing, delete the `~/.kwild` folder and the Postgres container:

```shell
# Remove kwild node data
rm -rf ~/.kwild

# Stop and remove the postgres container
docker container stop kwil-postgres
docker container rm -f kwil-postgres
```

## Multi-Node

To run a local Kwil network, you can use `kwild` to generate multiple node configs.

### Generate Configs

To generate the configs for 3 validators in `./kwil-testnet`, run:

```bash
kwild setup testnet -v 3 -u --out-dir ./kwil-testnet --db-owner <YOUR_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS>
```

This creates three nodes that can run on the same host for evaluation. Note the `-u` flag, which assigns unique ports for each node.
A production network would comprise nodes on different machines, but with the same `genesis.json` file.

### Run Nodes

First start `postgres` containers for each of the nodes. Use the following
commands to start all three running in the background and listening on ports 5440-5442.

```bash
docker run -d -p 5440:5432 -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" \
    --name node0 -d kwildb/postgres:latest
docker run -d -p 5441:5432 -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" \
    --name node1 -d kwildb/postgres:latest
docker run -d -p 5442:5432 -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" \
    --name node2 -d kwildb/postgres:latest
```

:::tip
Use `docker container ls` to check the `postgres` container status. When done testing
`kwild`, use `docker container rm -f -v node0 node1 node2` to stop and delete them.
:::

To run the nodes, we can use the `kwild` binary in 3 separate terminals.  We will need to specify the `--root` flag to
point to the directory where the node config is located.

```bash title="Terminal 1"
kwild start --root ./kwil-testnet/node0 --db.port 5440
```

```bash title="Terminal 2"
kwild start --root ./kwil-testnet/node1 --db.port 5441
```

```bash title="Terminal 3"
kwild start --root ./kwil-testnet/node2 --db.port 5442
```

Once the nodes are running, they will begin mining blocks.  You can now connect to their JSON-RPC
endpoints to interact with your local network.

### Cleanup

To clean up when done testing, delete the `./kwil-testnet` folder and the Postgres containers:

```shell
# Remove kwild node data
rm -rf ./kwil-testnet
# Stop and remove the postgres containers and their anonymous volumes
docker container rm -f -v node0 node1 node2
```

## For Developers

Given a clone of the source code repository and development tooling, there are
other automated options for starting nodes for testing in the
[README](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/blob/main/README.md). In
particular, a Docker Compose service is defined in `deployments/compose/kwil`
that automatically starts containers for both a single node with `--autogen` and
a separate container for `postgres`. For a multi-node development environment,
the command `task dev:testnet:up` will start several nodes in a network
configuration.
