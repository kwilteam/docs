## Installation

To run either a single Kwil node, or a network of nodes, you will need to download the binaries.  Kwil releases
binaries on [Github](<https://github.com/kwilteam/binary-releases/releases>).

Kwil also requires a dedicate PostgreSQL host configured for `kwild`.

See the [Installation](/docs/daemon/installation) page for details.

## Single Node

To run a single node, simply use the `kwild` binary with the `--autogen` flag.  This will automatically generate a
genesis file, private key, and more in the `~/.kwild` directory.

```bash
kwild --autogen
```

:::note
The `--autogen` flag generates a random chain ID, which is the network's identity, as well as a new initial validator private key.
The node will be the one initial validator.
As such, this mode is primarily useful for a quick deployment for evaluation and testing; production networks will define their own chain ID and initial validator set.
:::

## Multi-Node

To run a local Kwil network, you can use the `kwil-admin` tool to generate multiple node configs.

### Generate Configs

To generate the configs for 3 validators in `./kwil-testnet`, run:

```bash
kwil-admin setup testnet -v 3 --hostnames "localhost,localhost,localhost" --output-dir ./kwil-testnet
```

This creates three nodes that can run on the same host for evaluation.
A production network would comprise nodes on different machines, but with the same `genesis.json` file.

### Run Nodes

To run the nodes, we can use the `kwild` binary in 3 separate terminals.  We will need to specify the `--root_dir` flag to
point to the directory where the node config is located.

```bash title="Terminal 1"
kwild --root-dir ./kwil-testnet/node0
```

```bash title="Terminal 2"
kwild --root-dir ./kwil-testnet/node1
```

```bash title="Terminal 3"
kwild --root-dir ./kwil-testnet/node2
```

Once the nodes are running, they will begin mining blocks.  You can now connect to their gRPC and HTTP
endpoints to interact with your local network.
