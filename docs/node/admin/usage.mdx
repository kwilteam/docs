`kwil-admin` provides several functions for node setup and administration that
are accessible through sub-commands.

To show `kwil-admin` usage and all of the available top level commands, provide
the `-h` or `--help` flag:

```
$ kwil-admin -h
The Kwil node admin tool.

Usage:
  kwil-admin [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command
  key         The `key` command provides subcommands for private key generation and inspection.
  migrate     The `migrate` command provides functions for managing migration proposals.
  node        The `node` command is used to get information about a running Kwil node.
  peers       manages the node's peers
  setup       The `setup` command provides functions for creating and managing node configuration and data.
  snapshot    The `snapshot` command is used to create and manage snapshots.
  utils       The `utils` command is used to get information about a running Kwil node.

With the exception of `help` and `version`, each of the commands must be used
with a sub-command. For example, to list the `key` sub-commands:

```
$ kwil-admin key
The `key` command provides subcommands for private key generation and inspection. These are the private keys that identify the node on the network and provide validator transaction signing capability.

Global Flags:
      --output string   the format for command output - either 'text' or 'json' (default "text")
  -S, --silence         Silence logs

Use "kwil-admin key [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

To see usage of the `key info` sub command:

```
$ kwil-admin key info -h
Display information about a private key.

The private key can either be passed as a key file path, or as a hex-encoded string.
