Until the main Kwil DB repository is open source, the `kwil-admin` command line
application may be downloaded from the Kwil binary release repository.


## Download the `kwil-admin` Executable

The Kwil Admin Tool (`kwil-admin`) will be packaged together with Kwil Daemon (`kwild`) and Kwil Cli (`kwil-cli`).
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/releases)
for your platform.  Extract the `kwil-admin` file from the archive and put it
into a folder that is in your `PATH` environment.


## Verify Installation

Open a terminal and run the following at the command prompt:

```bash
kwil-admin version
```

If installed correctly, the displayed version should match the version of the release you downloaded.

Continue to the [Usage](/docs/admin/usage) page for a description of all the available commands.
