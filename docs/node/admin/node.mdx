description: Controlling a running node on the authenticated RPC service with the validator command
slug: /admin/node
---

The `node` command is used to control a running Kwil node via its authenticated
RPC service.

The subcommands share the following syntax:

```
kwil-admin node [--rpcserver RPCSERVER] [--authrpc-cert AUTHRPC-CERT]
  [--tlskey TLSKEY] [--tlscert TLSCERT] <command> [<args>]
```

## Setup

:::warning
The assumption is that the user of `kwil-admin` is the node
operator. Access must not be granted to untrusted parties.
:::

Communication between `kwil-admin` and `kwild` is both encrypted and
mutually-authenticated. Each side has their own key pair, where the node's is
used to encrypt the communications, and the client's is used to authenticate
itself with the node. Thus, setup involves generating client credentials, and
setting them as an authorized RPC client on the node.

Use of the `node` commands requires the following:

- The node's TLS (encrypted transport) certificate, specified with
  `--authrpc-cert`. The default is "kwild.cert". This would be retrieved from
  the node where it is located at `~/.kwild/rpc.cert` by default.
- RPC client credentials. This is a key pair used to authenticate `kwil-admin`
  (the client) with `kwild` (the server).  The key and certificate parts are
  specified by `--tlskey` and `--tlscert`.
- Adding the client certificate to the node's allowed clients, which is locate
  on the node machine as `~/.kwild/clients.pem` by default.
- Configure the Kwil node's `admin_listen_addr` so the service is accessible to
  `kwil-admin`. See [Kwil Node Configuration](/docs/category/configuration) for more
  information.

The `kwild` process may be running locally, on a remote host, or inside a Docker
container. Set and expose the admin RPC service ports as required.

:::note
Rapidly evolving procedures here. This is all likely to change soon.
:::

Described below are two ways to generate and set client credentials.

### Generation of Credentials on the Node

The node will generate its own TLS key and certificate, which is used encrypt
the communications on its authenticated RPC server. If the `--autogen` flag is
provided, the node will also generate new *client* credentials on start up if
the file `~/.kwild/clients.pem` does not exist. The corresponding
`auth.{cert,key}` files may then be used by the operator with `kwil-admin node`
commands for remote access to the node.

:::note
This approach is intended for "quickstart" workflows. The following method using
`kwil-admin` for generation is preferred.
:::

## Generation of Credentials by `kwil-admin`

The `kwil-admin node gen-auth-key` command may be used to generate new
credentials to `~/.kwil-admin/auth.{cert,key}`.

With this method, the contents of the `auth.cert` file must be appended to the
node's `clients.pem` file. Specifically,

1. Generate credentials with `kwil-admin node gen-auth-key`
2. Securely copy the `~/.kwil-admin/auth.cert` file to the machine where `kwild`
   is running, if it is not the same host.
3. Append the contents of the copied `auth.cert` to the node's `clients.pem` file.

  ```bash
  cat auth.cert >> ~/.kwild/clients.pem
  ```

If `kwil-admin` is being used on the same machine as `kwild`, you would skip the
copy step and do:

```bash
cat ~/.kwil-admin/auth.cert >> ~/.kwild/clients.pem
```

## Commands

The following commands perform node actions via the node's authenticated RPC
service, configured as described above. All flags are optional if the required
files are placed in the `~/.kwil-admin` folder.

```
Usage: kwil-admin node [--rpcserver RPCSERVER] [--authrpc-cert AUTHRPC-CERT]
  [--tlskey TLSKEY] [--tlscert TLSCERT] <command> [<args>]

Options:
  --rpcserver RPCSERVER, -s RPCSERVER
                         admin RPC server address [default: 127.0.0.1:50151]
  --authrpc-cert AUTHRPC-CERT
                         kwild's TLS certificate [default: kwild.cert]
  --tlskey TLSKEY        our TLS key file to establish a mTLS (authenticated)
                         connection [default: auth.key]
  --tlscert TLSCERT      our TLS certificate file for server to authenticate us
                         [default: auth.cert]
  --help, -h             display this help and exit
  --version              display version and exit
```

### Version

The `version` subcommand returns `kwild`'s version string set at compile time.
For example, a development version of `kwild` may report something similar to
the following:

```
$ kwil-admin node version
kwild version 0.5.1-pre+0975d68fb.dirty
```

### Status

Node status is requested with the `status` subcommand:

For example, `kwil-admin node status` returns JSON formatted status information:

```json
{
  "node": {
    "chain_id": "kwil-chain-nUkVIp",
    "name": "kwilnode42",
    "node_id": "9fde182db6dc5c2d5a08f395cdc9320a76a4f15d",
    "proto_ver": 8,
    "app_ver": 0,
    "block_ver": 0,
    "listen_addr": "tcp://0.0.0.0:26656",
    "rpc_addr": "tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"
  },
  "sync": {
    "app_hash": "51ffe4001668c0ea7791a2e8d647fe88d7542f2594e91382ca0a7026db6a1571",

    "best_block_height": 27462,
    "best_block_time": "2023-09-19T15:46:36.693-05:00",
    "syncing": false
  },
  "current_validator": {
    "pubkey": "d659e53ff403c52a1ae85445c51dd714d57e75b4ae6fa2e009a9082bfef870db",
    "pubkey_type": "ed25519",
    "power": 1
  }
}
```

### Peers

A list of the peers currently connected to the node are reported with the
`peers` subcommand. For example, the output of running `kwil-admin node peers`
on a node with 2 connected peers would look like:

```json
[
  {
    "node": {
      "chain_id": "chain-Ba2NYd",
      "name": "k2",
      "node_id": "658ea486c3fecf0e6869ad5fc632dd17fc35691a",
      "proto_ver": 8,
      "app_ver": 0,
      "block_ver": 0,
      "listen_addr": "tcp://127.0.0.1:26756",
      "rpc_addr": "tcp://127.0.0.1:26757"
    },
    "inbound": false,
    "remote_addr": "127.0.0.1"
  },
  {
    "node": {
      "chain_id": "chain-Ba2NYd",
      "name": "k3",
      "node_id": "8224ce41147ef2f791a06b1bf5e3fa77d0d543f6",
      "proto_ver": 8,
      "app_ver": 0,
      "block_ver": 0,
      "listen_addr": "tcp://127.0.0.1:26856",
      "rpc_addr": "tcp://127.0.0.1:26857"
    },
    "inbound": false,
    "remote_addr": "127.0.0.1"
  }
]
```
