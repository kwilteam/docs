The Kwil command line applications may be downloaded from the
[latest GitHub release](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/releases/latest).

## Download the `kwild` Executable

The Kwil daemon (`kwild`) will be packaged together with Kwil CLI (`kwil-cli`).
Download the latest release for your platform.  Extract these three executable files from the archive and put them
into a folder that is in your `PATH` environment.

## Verify Installation

Open a terminal and run the following at the command prompt:

```bash
kwild --version
```

If installed correctly, the displayed version info should match your downloaded version.

## Running Postgres

Continue to the [Running Postgres](/docs/daemon/running-postgres) page for instructions on how to run a properly configured
Postgres database for Kwil to use.
