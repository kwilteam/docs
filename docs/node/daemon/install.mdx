Until the main Kwil DB repository is open source, the `kwild` command line 
application may be downloaded from the Kwil binary release repository.


## Download the `kwild` Executable

The Kwil Daemon (`kwild`) will be packaged together with Kwil Admin Tool (`kwil-admin`) and Kwil Cli (`kwil-cli`).
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/kwilteam/binary-releases/releases)
for your platform.  Extract the `kwild` file from the archive and put it
into a folder that is in your `PATH` environment.


## Verify Installation

Open a terminal and run the following at the command prompt:

```bash
kwild --version
```

If installed correctly, it should display the version info match your downloaded version.

Continue to the [Using Kwild](./kwild) page for running Kwil node.
