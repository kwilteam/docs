description: Operational parameters
slug: /daemon/config/settings
---
This section provides a detailed overview of the operational parameters available in the `config.toml` file for configuring a Kwil node. These settings are grouped into three categories: chain-specific configurations related to the underlying blockchain operations, app-specific configurations that dictate the Kwil application's behavior, and logging configurations. Below are the explanations for each parameter:

## [log]

- `level`: This variable specifies the logging level of the Kwil application. By default, the level is set to `info`.

- `output_paths`: This variable specifies where logs are written to. You can designate multiple paths, separated by commas. By default, logs are directed to `stdout`.

- `format`: This variable specifies the log format, which can be either `plain` or `json`.

- `time_format`: This variable specifies the time format for logs. Options include `epochfloat` (default), `epochmilli`, and `rfc3339milli`.

## [app]   
   This section holds configurations specific to the Kwil application's operation.

   - `jsonrpc_listen_addr`: This variable specifies the address where the daemon's JSON-RPC server listens for connections. The default is `localhost:8484`.

   - `http_listen_addr`: This variable specifies the address where the daemon's HTTP server listens for connections. The default is `localhost:8080`.

   - `admin_listen_addr`: This variable specifies the address where the daemon's admin JSON-RPC server listens for connections. The default is `localhost:50151`.

   - `pg_db_host`: PostgreSQL database host (UNIX socket path or IP address with no port). The default is `localhost`.

   - `pg_db_port`: PostgreSQL database port (may be omitted for UNIX socket hosts). The default is `5432`.

   - `pg_db_user`: PostgreSQL database user (should be a "superuser"). The default is `kwild`.

   - `pg_db_pass`: PostgreSQL database pass (may be omitted for some pg_hba.conf configurations).

   - `pg_db_name`: PostgreSQL database name (override database name). The default is `kwild`.

   - `private_key_path`: This variable specifies the path for node's private key. If left unspecified, it defaults to `./private_key` relative to the root directory.

   - `extension_endpoints`: This variable specifies the endpoints for extensions, separated by commas.

   - `tls_cert_file`: This variable specifies the file path containing a certificate to enable TLS on the JSON-RPC server. This path can be either absolute or relative to the specified root directory. If unspecified, the JSON-RPC server's communications remain unencrypted.

   - `tls_key_file`: This variable specifies the file path containing the corresponding private key that enables TLS on the JSON-RPC server. Like the `tls_cert_file`, this path can be either absolute or relative to the specified root directory. If unspecified, the JSON-RPC server's communications remain unencrypted.

   - `hostname`: This variable sets the Kwil JSON-RPC server's hostname.

   - `snapshot_file`: This variable specifies the path to the snapshot file to be used for the initial state of the node. If the node is configured to start with initial state and this variable is not set, the node will fail to start.

   ### [app.snapshots]

      This section contains configurations for managing the snapshots of the kwild database.

      - `enabled`: This variable enables creation and serving of snapshots to support state sync on nodes joining the network.

      - `snapshot_dir`: This variable specifies the path to the snapshots directory.

      - `recurring_height`: This variable specifies the heights (multiples of heights) at which the database is snapshotted. The default is 10000, which is around 1 snapshot per day considering block rate of 1 block per 6-8 secs. 
 
      - `max_snapshots`: This variable specifies the maximum number of snapshots to store on disk. The default is 3 snapshots.

## [chain]
This section contains configuration specific to the CometBFT-based blockchain.

   - `moniker`: This variable specifies a custom, human-readable name for the node.

   ### [chain.rpc]

      This section offers configurations for managing the blockchain's RPC service.

      - `listen_addr`: This variable specifies the listening address for the blockchain's RPC server. The default is `tcp://127.0.0.1:26657`.

      - `broadcast-tx-timeout`: This variable specifies the time to wait for a transaction to be committed when authored with --sync flag in the CLI. The default is 10s.

   ### [chain.consensus]

      This section provides configurations for managing blockchain consensus. These are only important for validators. They should be set according to the network configuration.

      - `timeout_propose`: This variable specifies the time to wait for a proposal block before prevoting nil. Default timeout is 3s.

      - `timeout_prevote`: This variable specifies the time to wait after receiving +2/3 prevotes. Default timeout is 2s.

      - `timeout_precommit`: This variable specifies the time to wait after receiving +2/3 precommits. Default timeout is 2s.

      - `timeout_commit`: This variable specifies the time to wait after committing a block before starting on the new height. Default timeout is 6s.

   ### [chain.p2p]

      This section outlines configurations for the P2P service, which manages peer-to-peer connectivity within the blockchain network.

      - `listen_addr`: This variable specifies the address for listening to the incoming peer connections. The default is `tcp://0.0.0.0:26656`.

      - `external_address`: This variable specifies the address for peers to connect to. If left empty, it defaults to the same port as the `listen_addr` and will introspect based on the listener.

      - `persistent_peers`: This variable specifies a comma-separated list of nodes to consistently connect to.

      - `pex`: A toggle to enable peer exchange, an ongoing function of the node used to share known peers with other nodes.

      - `seeds`: This variable specifies a comma-separated list of seed nodes or dedicated seeders services used to provide peer addresses when bootstrapping. This is unused if there are entries in the address book.

      - `seed_mode`: A toggle to run in a special "seed mode" where kwild constantly crawls the network to obtain a large address book, which it shares with incoming nodes before disconnecting them. A node running with this setting would be used only to bootstrap other nodes via their `seeds` setting. This is not appropriate for a validator or an RPC service provider.

      - `addr_book_strict`: A toggle for enforcing strict address routability rules. By default, nodes with routable addresses are considered for connection. However, if this setting is disabled, non-routable IP addresses, like addresses in a private network can be added to the address book.

      - `max_num_inbound_peers`: This variable specifies the maximum number of inbound peers.

      - `max_num_outbound_peers`: This variable specifies the maximum number of outbound peers to connect to, excluding persistent peers.

      - `unconditional_peer_ids`: This variable specifies a comma separated list of node ID's that will always have connections (re)established, regardless of the connection limits.

      - `allow_duplicate_ip`: A toggle to prevent multiple peers from using the same IP address.

   ### [chain.mempool]
   
      This section discusses the configurations for the blockchain's transaction mempool.

      - `size`: This variable specifies the mempool's maximum transaction count.

      - `max_txs_bytes`: This variable specifies the limit on the total size of all transactions in the mempool.

      - `cache_size`: This variable specifies the cache size used to filter previously seen transactions.

   ### [chain.statesync]

      This section provides configuration to enable state sync instead of block sync to catchup with the network.

      - `enable`: This variable toggles the state sync feature on or off. By default, the state sync feature is disabled and the node uses block sync to catch up with the network.

      - `rpc_servers`: This variable specifies a list of trusted snapshot providers. It is a comma-seperated list of chain RPC servers and requires atleast 2 servers to enable statesync. These servers act as the source-of-truth for the snapshot integrity and also responsible for creating, distributing and validating snapshots. These servers should have [snapshot configuration](#appsnapshots) enabled.

      - `discovery_time`: This variable specifies the time to spend discovering snapshots before offering the latest snapshot to the ABCI application. The default is 15s. The node will repeat this process until it finds a valid snapshot. If there are no snapshots available in the network, restart the node with block sync enabled to make progress with the node syncing.

      - `chunk_request_timeout`: This variable specifies the timeout duration before re-requesting a chunk, possibly from a different peer.

This is the structure in which these configs must appear in the `config.toml` file.

## Sample config.toml

Here is an example of a `config.toml` file with complete configuration:

## Config Override

Every `config.toml` entry can be overridden using either environment variables or command line flags. 

The order of priority is `flags > env variables > config.toml > defaults`. 

The structure of `config.toml` is hierarchical, using sections and subsections. Below are the rules to translate a field from `config.toml` to environment variables or command line flags.

:::note Translation rules
```toml title=config.toml
[section]
field = "val"

[section.subsection]
other_field = "val"
```

The corresponding command line flags and environment variables for `field` and
`other_field` are as follows:

| Flag                               | Environment Variable                   |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `--section.field`                  | `KWILD_SECTION_FIELD`                  |
| `--section.subsection.other-field` | `KWILD_SECTION_SUBSECTION_OTHER_FIELD` |
:::
