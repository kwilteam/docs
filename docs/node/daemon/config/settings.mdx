description: Operational parameters
slug: /daemon/config/settings
---
This section provides a detailed overview of the operational parameters available in the `config.toml` file for configuring a Kwil node. These settings are grouped into three categories: chain-specific configurations related to the underlying blockchain operations, app-specific configurations that dictate the Kwil application's behavior, and logging configurations. Below are the explanations for each parameter:

## [log]

- `level`: This variable specifies the logging level of the Kwil application. By default, the level is set to `info`.

- `output_paths`: This variable specifies where logs are written to. You can designate multiple paths, separated by commas. By default, logs are directed to `stdout`.

- `format`: This variable specifies the log format, which can be either `plain` or `json`.

- `time_format`: This variable specifies the time format for logs. Options include `epochfloat` (default), `epochmilli`, and `rfc3339milli`.

## [app]   
This section holds configurations specific to the Kwil application's operation.

- `grpc_listen_addr`: This variable specifies the address where the daemon's gRPC server listens for connections. The default is `localhost:50051`.

- `http_listen_addr`: This variable specifies the address where the daemon's HTTP server listens for connections. The default is `localhost:8080`.

- `admin_listen_addr`: This variable specifies the address where the daemon's admin gRPC server listens for connections. The default is `localhost:50151`.

- `pg_db_host`: PostgreSQL database host (UNIX socket path or IP address with no port). The default is `/var/run/postgresql`.

- `pg_db_port`: PostgreSQL database port (may be omitted for UNIX socket hosts). The default is `5432`.

- `pg_db_user`: PostgreSQL database user (should be a "superuser"). The default is `kwild`.

- `pg_db_pass`: PostgreSQL database pass (may be omitted for some pg_hba.conf configurations).

- `pg_db_name`: PostgreSQL database name (override database name). The default is `kwild`.

- `private_key_path`: This variable specifies the path for node's private key. If left unspecified, it defaults to `./private_key` relative to the root directory.

- `extension_endpoints`: This variable specifies the endpoints for extensions, separated by commas.

- `tls_cert_file`: This variable specifies the file path containing a certificate to enable TLS on the gRPC server. This path can be either absolute or relative to the specified root directory. If unspecified, the gRPC server's communications remain unencrypted.

- `tls_key_file`: This variable specifies the file path containing the corresponding private key that enables TLS on the gRPC server. Like the `tls_cert_file`, this path can be either absolute or relative to the specified root directory. If unspecified, the gRPC server's communications remain unencrypted.

- `hostname`: This variable sets the Kwil gRPC server's hostname.

## [chain]
This section contains configuration specific to the CometBFT-based blockchain.

   - `moniker`: This variable specifies a custom, human-readable name for the node.

   ### [chain.rpc]

      This section offers configurations for managing the blockchain's RPC service.

      - `listen_addr`: This variable specifies the listening address for the blockchain's RPC server. The default is `tcp://127.0.0.1:26657`.

   ### [chain.consensus]

      This section provides configurations for managing blockchain consensus. These are only important for validators. They should be set according to the network configuration.

      - `timeout_propose`: This variable specifies the time to wait for a proposal block before prevoting nil. Default timeout is 3s.

      - `timeout_prevote`: This variable specifies the time to wait after receiving +2/3 prevotes. Default timeout is 2s.

      - `timeout_precommit`: This variable specifies the time to wait after receiving +2/3 precommits. Default timeout is 2s.

      - `timeout_commit`: This variable specifies the time to wait after committing a block before starting on the new height. Default timeout is 6s.

   ### [chain.p2p]

      This section outlines configurations for the P2P service, which manages peer-to-peer connectivity within the blockchain network.

      - `listen_addr`: This variable specifies the address for listening to the incoming peer connections. The default is `tcp://0.0.0.0:26656`.

      - `external_address`: This variable specifies the address for peers to connect to. If left empty, it defaults to the same port as the `listen_addr` and will introspect based on the listener.

      - `persistent_peers`: This variable specifies a comma-separated list of nodes to consistently connect to.

      - `pex`: A toggle to enable peer exchange, an ongoing function of the node used to share known peers with other nodes.

      - `seeds`: This variable specifies a comma-separated list of seed nodes or dedicated seeders services used to provide peer addresses when bootstrapping. This is unused if there are entries in the address book.

      - `seed_mode`: A toggle to run in a special "seed mode" where kwild constantly crawls the network to obtain a large address book, which it shares with incoming nodes before disconnecting them. A node running with this setting would be used only to bootstrap other nodes via their `seeds` setting. This is not appropriate for a validator or an RPC service provider.

      - `addr_book_strict`: A toggle for enforcing strict address routability rules. By default, nodes with routable addresses are considered for connection. However, if this setting is disabled, non-routable IP addresses, like addresses in a private network can be added to the address book.

      - `max_num_inbound_peers`: This variable specifies the maximum number of inbound peers.

      - `max_num_outbound_peers`: This variable specifies the maximum number of outbound peers to connect to, excluding persistent peers.

      - `unconditional_peer_ids`: This variable specifies a comma separated list of node ID's that will always have connections (re)established, regardless of the connection limits.

      - `allow_duplicate_ip`: A toggle to prevent multiple peers from using the same IP address.

   ### [chain.mempool]
   
      This section discusses the configurations for the blockchain's transaction mempool.

      - `size`: This variable specifies the mempool's maximum transaction count.

      - `max_txs_bytes`: This variable specifies the limit on the total size of all transactions in the mempool.

      - `cache_size`: This variable specifies the cache size used to filter previously seen transactions.

This is the structure in which these configs must appear in the `config.toml` file.

## Sample config.toml

Here is an example of a `config.toml` file with complete configuration:

<details>
  <summary>sample config.toml file </summary>

```yaml
# This is a TOML config file.
# For more information, see https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

# NOTE: Any path below can be absolute (e.g. "/var/myapp/data") or
# relative to the home directory (e.g. "data")

# Root Directory Structure:
# RootDir/
#   |- config.toml   (app and chain configuration for running the kwild node)
#   |- genesis.json  (genesis file for the network)
#   |- private_key   (node's private key)
#   |- abci/
#   |   |- addrbook.json  (peer routable addresses for the kwild node)
#   |   |- data/          (blockchain files: blockstore.db, state.db, etc)
#   |   |- info/
#   |- application/
#   |- signing/

# Required files: config.toml, private_key, and genesis files
# The rest of the files & directories are created on the node startup

## Config Override

Every `config.toml` entry can be overridden using either environment variables or command line flags. 

The order of priority is `flags > env variables > config.toml > defaults`. 

The structure of `config.toml` is hierarchical, using sections and subsections. Below are the rules to translate a field from `config.toml` to environment variables or command line flags.

:::note Translation rules
```toml title=config.toml
[section]
field = "val"

[section.subsection]
other_field = "val"
```

The corresponding command line flags and environment variables for `field` and
`other_field` are as follows:

| Flag                               | Environment Variable                   |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `--section.field`                  | `KWILD_SECTION_FIELD`                  |
| `--section.subsection.other-field` | `KWILD_SECTION_SUBSECTION_OTHER_FIELD` |
