## Genesis File

The genesis file defines the initial state and parameters needed to bootstrap a
new blockchain network. It serves as the starting point for the entire
blockchain by configuring key aspects of the network, including its initial
validators, the DB administrator, initial height, and other consensus
parameters.

All the nodes in the network **must** have the same genesis file to start with
the same initial conditions. Any discrepancies or errors in the genesis file
could prohibit the node from joining the network or producing blocks.

## Example

Below is an example `genesis.json` file featuring a basic configuration:

```json title="example genesis.json file"
{
  "chain_id": "kwil-testnet",
  "initial_height": 0,
  "app_hash": null,
  "db_owner": "0xE0f13c95225F34f86E99f83984e286dcaF321E37",

## Parameters

### Chain ID

`chain_id`: Uniquely identifies the blockchain network and should not exceed 50 characters.

### Initial Height

`initial_height`: The initial height the blockchain should begin at. It should be set to 0 for a new chain that is not migrated from a previous chain.

### DB Owner

`db_owner`: The owner owner (administrator) of the Kwil database schemas. This is given in the string format used by the Kwil engine's `@caller` variable, which is derived from the user's public key. Typically this will be the corresponding Ethereum address.

### Initial Funding Allocations

`alloc`: A list of Kwil accounts and their initial balances at the genesis. This field is optional and is used to pre-fund Kwil accounts with balance. The `id` field is the Kwil account ID string, which may be an ethereum address in the case of user funding or a public key in the case of validator funding. The `key_type` field specifies the type of the account's public key, which is "secp256k1" for Ethereum users. The `amount` field specifies the initial balance of the account.

### Validators

`validators`: The list of the initial set of validators. Each validator has a cryptographic key-pair and an associated voting power.
  - `pubkey`: The validator's public key bytes (hexadecimal).
  - `type`: The type of the validator's public key (e.g. `secp256k1`).
  - `power`: The validator's voting power. Power 0 indicates that the node is a non-validator.

### Leader

`leader`: The initial leader of the blockchain. The leader is a special validator that is responsible for proposing new blocks.

### App Hash

`app_hash`: The hash generated from the initial application state, which is only used in the case of a migration where the `genesis_state` setting in the `config.toml` specifies the path to the snapshot file of the previous chain.

### Block Rules:

`max_block_size`: The maximum block size, in bytes.

### Validator Join Request Expiry:

`join_expiry`: The duration after which the validator join request expires if not approved. The default expiry is 24hrs blocks, which is equivalent to 1 day if blocks are produced at the rate of 1 block/sec.

### Disabled Gas Costs

`disable_gas_costs`:  This field sets whether gas costs should be enabled for the transactions. With gas costs disabled, no fees are incurred for transactions.

### Max Votes Per Tx

`max_votes_per_tx`: The maximum number of validator resolution votes that can be included in a single transaction.

### Migrations:

`migration`:
  - `start_height`: The start height of the migration on the old network. Specifies the height from which the state changes are to be replicated onto the new network.
  - `end_height`: The end height of the migration on the old network. Specifies the height until which the state changes are to be replicated onto the new network.
