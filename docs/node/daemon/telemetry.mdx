description: Using Telemetry with kwild to Collect Metrics
slug: /daemon/telemetry
---

`kwild` has the ability to record various package-level metrics and push the
recorded data to a remote OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) collector.
This page describes how to enable and configure this capability in `kwild`,
and how to run a basic telemetry pipeline.

## Enabling Telemetry in `kwild`

To use telemetry with `kwild`, it must be enabled and configured with the
following settings:

```toml
# telemetry (metrics and traces) configuration
[telemetry]

# enable telemetry
enable = true

# open telemetry protocol collector endpoint
otlp_endpoint = '127.0.0.1:4318'
```

First, set `enable` to true in the above section of `config.toml`, or use the
`--telemetry.enable` command line flag.

Next, set the `otlp_endpoint` setting to the address (in host:port format) of a
process that supports the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP), such as the official
OpenTelemetry Collector, which is described in the next section.

`kwild` will *push* metrics data to this OTLP process at runtime. As such, the
collector should be running whenever `kwild` is running

## Running the OpenTelemetry Collector

The [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) can receive
metrics from `kwild`, and export them to many possible observability backends.

The `kwil-db` repository provides a basic configuration file at `contrib/otel/otel-config.yaml`.
This file configures the collector to listen on port 4318 for OTLP
connections *from* `kwild`, and to export metrics to both a Prometheus instance on port 9464
and to standard output for debugging.

:::tip
`contrib/otel/otel-config.yaml` also contains an exporter definition for InfluxDB
that may be enabled by including it in the `service.pipelines.metrics.exporters` array.
:::

Start the collector with the `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib` Docker image
from the root of the `kwil-db` repository as follows:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 4318:4318 -p 9464:9464 --name otel-col \
  -v $(pwd)/contrib/otel/otel-config.yaml:/etc/otel-config.yaml \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib  --config /etc/otel-config.yaml
```

This creates and runs a new Docker container using the referenced `yaml` config
file mounted inside the image as `/etc/otel-config.yaml`, with port 4318
exposed to accept incoming OTLP connections from `kwild`, and port 9496 exposed
to accept incoming connections from a Prometheus instance that will scrape and
persist the metrics data.

See [Collector Quick start](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/quick-start/)
for more information.

## Running a Prometheus Metrics Scraper

A Prometheus service may be installed in different ways, including operating
system packages, building from source, or using a Docker Image.
We will start the `prom/prometheus` Docker image as follows:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 9090:9090 --name prom \
  -v $(pwd)/contrib/otel/prom.yaml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  prom/prometheus
```

This will start a Prometheus service exposed on port 9090 of the host machine.
It will periodically scape and store metrics from the OpenTelemetry Collector.
The `kwil-db` repository provides a basic Prometheus configuration file at
`contrib/otel/prom.yaml`:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 10s  # How often to scrape targets

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "otel-collector"
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["host.docker.internal:9464"]  # Scrape the OTEL Collector's metrics
```

This config is defined to connect with the OpenTelemetry Collector we started
listening on port 9464 in the other Docker container. The `host.docker.internal`
host name works for the internal Docker Desktop network; when using Docker Daemon alone,
it may be necessary to change this to the collector's docker container name
(`otel-col` in the previous `docker run` command) *and* to create and use a
named Docker network with both containers.

See the [Prometheus installation guide](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/)
for more information.

## Viewing the Metrics

There are a variety of user interfaces that can display the metrics collected
on a Prometheus service. A common solution for exploring metrics and creating
dashboards is Grafana. Simply install and point it to `http://127.0.0.1:9090`.
It is recommended to use the "Explore" page to discover the available metrics.

See [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/explore/)
for more information.
