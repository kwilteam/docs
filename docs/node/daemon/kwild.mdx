slug: /daemon/kwild
---

The `kwild` command starts the blockchain and the database services of the Kwil node. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to launch a Kwil node.

## Root Directory

This is the default directory to store all the configuration and data such as blockchain data, SQL database data, signed messages, etc, unless specified otherwise.

```text
home_dir/
   |- genesis.json 
   |- config.toml
   |- private_key         
   |- abci/                     # chain root directory, stores blockchain data & config
   |   |- data/ 
```

The default root directory is `~/.kwild`. You can override this configuration by setting the `KWILD_ROOT_DIR` environment variable or using the `--root-dir` command line flag.

## Requirements

The `kwild` commands on this page assume you have configured a PostgreSQL host
as described in [Installation](/docs/daemon/installation).

## Quickstart

Quickstart mode can be used to swiftly deploy a node without delving into the configuration details.  To run in this mode, use the `kwild` command with the `--autogen` flag.

```bash
kwild --autogen
```

This command will auto-generate the necessary configuration in the root directory and starts the node using this configuration. This also create a new private chain with the initialized node as its sole member and validator.

It's crucial to note, however, that the node operates under a default configuration in the quickstart mode. For production deployments, it's highly recommended to tailor the configuration to your specific needs, as discussed in subsequent sections.

## Configuration

Running a Kwil node requires `genesis.json`, `config.toml` and `private_key` files. All these configuration files must be present under the root directory. This section describes in detail on how to initialize the root directory with these configuration files.

### Private Keys

Kwil nodes use ed25519 keys for validator related operations. Refer to the [key management guide](/docs/admin/keys#generation) for generating these node keys. The default location of private_key is `root_dir/private_key`. You can override this configuration by setting the `KWILD_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` environment variable or using the `app.private-key-path` command line flag.

### Genesis File (genesis.json)

To deploy a new Kwil network, copy the sample [genesis.json](/docs/daemon/config/genesis#complete-genesis-configuration) into `root_dir/abci/config/genesis.json`. Manually update the `chain_id`, `initial_height`, `app_hash` configurations in the `genesis.json` file.

To start the node as a validator, the node's public key in hex format must be listed under the `validators` in the genesis file as shown below. Refer to the [key management guide](/docs/admin/keys#key-information) to view the public key, address and node ID corresponding to the node's private key.

```json title="Genesis Validators"
  "validators": [
    {
      "pub_key": "71d79c64ffb46e8f6c36f1429066a9d92f6adf5bbe546204e40ec5559478b6aa",
      "power": 1,
      "name": "validator-0"
    }
  ],
```

Refer to the [genesis specification](/docs/daemon/config/genesis#advanced-configurations) for advanced configuration options.

To connect a node to an existing network, obtain the genesis file from the desired network and set it as the genesis file for that node.

### Config File (config.toml)

Copy the sample [config.toml](/docs/daemon/config/settings#sample-configtoml) into `root_dir/config.toml` and update the configuration as required.

Notable options include the RPC and HTTP server settings such as `app.grpc-listen-addr`, `app.http-listen-addr`, `chain.rpc.listen-addr` and `chain.p2p.listen-addr`.

There are two settings related to establishing connections to other network nodes:

- `chain.p2p.persistent-peers` is used to maintain persistent connections with certain nodes.
- `chain.p2p.seeds` specifies special seed nodes or services from which additional peer addresses are obtained.

The above fields can be empty if the network is made up of a standalone node.

Refer to the [configuration specification](/docs/daemon/config/settings) for more options on tuning a Kwil application.

### Configuration Override

The Kwil application supports the ability to override the configuration at node startup through the command line flags and environment variables.
Use `--help or -h` for detailed information on all the parameters that can be overwritten through command line flags.

For instance, to modify the log level and chain RPC address during the node startup, you can use one of the following methods:

```bash title="Environment variable"
KWILD_LOG_LEVEL=debug
KWILD_CHAIN_RPC_LISTEN_ADDRESS="tcp://127.0.0.1:26656"

kwild --root-dir "path/to/root/dir"
```

```bash title="Command line flags"
kwild --root-dir "path/to/root/dir" --log.level "debug" --chain.rpc.listen-addr "tcp://127.0.0.1:26656"
```

```bash title="Both environment and command line flags"
KWILD_LOG_LEVEL=debug
KWILD_CHAIN_RPC_LISTEN_ADDRESS="tcp://127.0.0.1:26656"

kwild --root-dir "path/to/root/dir" --log.level "info" --chain.rpc.listen-addr "tcp://192.168.1.20:30000"
```

If both flags and env variables are set, flags take precedence over environment variables. Therefore, in this example, the Kwil application uses `info` log level and RPC listen address as `tcp://192.168.1.20:30000`.

:::tip
Option names in the TOML configuration file and environment variables use underscores ("_") to separate words within the name, while the command line flags use dashes ("-").
:::

Refer to the [translation guide](/docs/daemon/config/settings#config-override) for more information on mapping the config parameters to the command line flags and environment variables.

## Deploy a Kwil Network

A private Kwil network with a standalone node can be deployed by running `kwild` as shown below:

```bash
kwild --root-dir "path/to/root/dir"
```

The root directory must have the required configuration for the node to start successfully. If you are using [quickstart mode](/docs/daemon/kwild#quickstart), this root directory will be generated for you if it does not exist.

Whether this node starts as a validator or a non-validator is determined by its presence in the initial validator list within the genesis file.

## Connecting To A Kwil Network

To connect to an existing Kwil network during startup:

- Obtain the `genesis.json` for the desired network from a network authority, and ensure that it is placed in your `root-dir`.
- Set `chain.p2p.seeds` and/or `chain.p2p.persistent-peers`. `seeds` is a comma-separated list of `nodeid@ip:port` seed nodes used to obtain initial peer addresses, while `persistent-peers` are peers to stay connected to.
- Start `kwild`.

  In the following examples, we are setting `persistent-peers` to two known network nodes with which `kwild` should maintain persistent connections.

  ```bash title="Command line flag:  --chain.p2p.persistent-peers"
  kwild --root-dir "path/to/root/dir" --chain.p2p.persistent-peers "d128266b8b9f64c313de466cf29e0a6182dba54d@172.10.100.2:26656,9440f4a8059cf7ff31454973c4f9c68de65fe526@172.10.100.3:26656"
  ```

  ```bash title="Environment variable:  KWILD_CHAIN_P2P_PERSISTENT_PEERS"
  KWILD_CHAIN_P2P_PERSISTENT_PEERS="d128266b8b9f64c313de466cf29e0a6182dba54d@172.10.100.2:26656,9440f4a8059cf7ff31454973c4f9c68de65fe526@172.10.100.3:26656"

  kwild --root-dir "path/to/root/dir"
  ```

  ```bash title="persistent_peers option in config.toml"
  [chain.p2p]
  persistent_peers = "d128266b8b9f64c313de466cf29e0a6182dba54d@172.10.100.2:26656,9440f4a8059cf7ff31454973c4f9c68de65fe526@172.10.100.3:26656"

  kwild --root-dir "path/to/root/dir"
  ```

- Note that this node joins the network by default as a non-validator. Please refer to the [Validator Guide](/docs/node/tutorial) for more information on becoming a validator node.

## Kwil Admin Tools

The `kwil-admin setup` tools can be used to quickly setup the configuration required for running either a standalone node or a network of nodes. Refer to the [setup guide](/docs/admin/setup#quick-setup-of-a-single-kwil-node) for more information on its usage.
