description: Running extensions with Kwild

[Extensions](/docs/category/extensions) can be run as separate processes that contain arbitrary business logic.  The Kwil daemon interacts with extensions over a
predefined [gRPC interface](<https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-extensions/blob/main/proto/extension.proto>). Any gRPC server (written in any language) that implements this
interface can be run as a Kwil extension.

While extensions can be run as distributed infrastructure, **it is recommended to run them as containerized sidecars**. Running them as sidecars helps prevent
a lot of transient errors that can occur when running them as distributed infrastructure.  Containerization forces them to run with sandboxed resources, preventing
them from crashing the daemon (which can cause database corruption).

To learn more about building extensions, see the [extensions](/docs/node/extensions) section.

## Using Extensions

Extension endpoints can be given to a Kwil node using configuration.  To do this, simply pass the extension endpoints as a flag
to the daemon:

```bash
kwild --app.extension-endpoints "localhost:50052,localhost:50053"
```
