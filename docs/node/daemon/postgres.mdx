Kwil is built on PostgreSQL, and requires an external PostgreSQL host running and configured for `kwild`. `kwild` currently requires PostgreSQL 16, from at least v16.1. Future major
versions will require an update to Kwil.

### Quickstart PostgreSQL

For quick usage, Kwil provides a Docker image with a properly configured
PostgreSQL instance. This is convenient for quick setup of a Kwil node, but is
less configurable than a system service. The following command will pull and
start a new container:

```bash
docker run -p 5432:5432 --name kwil-postgres -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" \
    --shm-size 256m kwildb/postgres:latest
```

Be sure to disable any OS unattended upgrades to prevent `"docker"`, `"containerd"`, and
`"postgresql"` packages from being updated while the node is running.

### PostgreSQL Installation

Standard PostgreSQL installers and operating system packages are supported.
We also provide Docker images and Compose service definitions with the required
settings, roles, and databases pre-configured for ease of deployment and evaluation.

The recommended options are:

* System installation of `postgres`. This requires some manual configuration.
* The [`kwildb/postgres`](https://hub.docker.com/r/kwildb/postgres) Docker image
  on Docker Hub. It is pre-configured for `kwild` and is convenient for quick
  setup, but may be less reliable or secure than a manually configured
  `postgres` instance.

:::info
If a user-provided installation of PostgreSQL, such as an operating system
`postgres` package, is used, the configuration must be changed as described in [PostgreSQL Configuration](#postgresql-configuration).
:::

See the [README](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/blob/main/README.md)
for other convenient methods for developers to start test nodes or networks.

#### System Install

An operator may use a system installation of `postgres` from one of the
[official PostgreSQL installers](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or
operating system packages managers.

Be sure to install version-specific packages, such as `postgresql-16`, rather than
a metapackage that will automatically install the latest major version, which may
not be supported by Kwil.

:::tip
It is recommended to use a postgresql.org repository, such as the ["pgdg" Ubuntu
Apt Repository](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt) rather than the operating system's own packages.

Also, be sure any unattended upgrades exclude the PostgreSQL package to prevent
it from restarting while in used. For instance, on Debian-based systems,
configure
[`Unattended-Upgrade::Package-Blacklist`](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates#Using_the_.22unattended-upgrades.22_package).
with an entry for `"postgresql-*"`.
:::

Finally, a system install of `postgres` requires making some configuration
changes to support `kwild`. These are described in the [PostgreSQL Configuration](#postgresql-configuration) section.

#### Docker Image

The [`kwildb/postgres`](https://hub.docker.com/r/kwildb/postgres) Docker image
is available on Docker Hub. This is convenient for quick setup of a Kwil node,
but is less configurable than a system service. The following command will pull
and start a new container:

```bash
docker run -p 5432:5432 -v kwil-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data --shm-size 256m \
    -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" kwildb/postgres:latest
```

The above will start a pre-configured `postgres` in a Docker container, using a
persistent Docker volume named `kwil-pgdata`. To require authentication, use
`"POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypass"` to set the `postgres` superuser password instead
of `"POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust"`.

This service automatically creates a `"kwild"` database owned by a `"kwild"`
role. The password for this user is initially `"kwild"`, which would be
specified with the `kwild` flag `--app.pg-db-pass` flag if not using "trust" authentication.
Use [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) if you wish to change it.

:::info
This service exposes `postgres` on port 5432 of the *host* machine so that it
may be accessed for administrative purposes from the host machine via `psql`.
This means that it will fail to start if there is a process on the host machine
already listening on port 5432.
:::

If resetting `kwild`'s data folders, it is also necessary to delete the
`kwil-pgdata` Docker volume, or whatever named volume was used in the `docker run`
command. Ensure that the Docker Daemon is running and configured so that
the `postgres` service has sufficient disk, CPU, and memory resources for demand
of your application.

:::tip
If using Docker Daemon directly rather than Docker Desktop, such as would be the
case on a headless server, it is recommended to modify the Docker configuration
to disable the "userland proxy" for performance reasons.

Also, if the system disk partition has limited free space or uses a slow block
device, as is common on certain cloud providers, either change the `"data-root"`
Docker setting or use a suitable host file system path rather than a named volume.

Modify the docker configuration as follows, setting `"userland-proxy"` to
`false`, and `"data-root"` to the location of a directory on a file system with
sufficient free disk space and performance characteristics:

```json title="/etc/docker/daemon.json"
{
  "userland-proxy": false,
  "data-root": "/mnt/suitable_drive/docker"
}
```

If changing `"data-root"`, be sure to copy the previous Docker folder, which is
typically `/var/lib/docker`.

### PostgreSQL Configuration

When using Kwil's Postgres Docker image (`kwildb/postgres`) or one of the Docker Compose service definitions described in the
previous section, no changes to the `postgres` process configuration are
required, **skip this section** and proceed to [Running `kwild`](#running-kwild).

If using any other installation of PostgreSQL such as from an operating system
package manager, it is necessary to change a few settings in the
`postgresql.conf` file. Once reconfigured, it may also be necessary to create a
new database and "role" to match `kwild`'s configuration.

#### PostgreSQL Settings

`kwild` requires some changes to the default `postgres` configuration:

- `wal_level` set to `"logical"` to enable logical replication functionality
- `max_wal_senders` at least `10`
- `max_replication_slots` at least `10`
- `max_prepared_transactions` at least 2 for two-phase commit capability

In addition to the above non-default settings, `kwild` will also verify the
following settings, which are satisfied by `postgres` defaults:

- `synchronous_commit = on`
- `fsync = on`
- `max_connections` at least `50` (the default is usually 100)

:::tip
It is recommended to enable data checksums on the database cluster.
See the [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/checksums.html) for more information.
The provided Docker Compose services do this automatically.
:::

#### PostgreSQL Initialization

Depending on `kwild` configuration, is may be necessary to create a `postgres`
[role](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/user-manag.html) and
[database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/manage-ag-overview.html).

The relevant `kwild` settings are:

- `db.host` is the host name for the `postgres` server. Default is
  127.0.0.1, but may also be a path to a UNIX socket such as `/var/run/postgresql`.
  Most PostgreSQL packages are configured to listen on both by default.
- `db.port` is the TCP port for the `postgres` server. Default is 5432.
  This setting is ignored if a UNIX socket is used for `db.host`.
- `db.user` is the name of the role (like a user). Default is `kwild`.
- `db.pass` is the password for the role specified by `db.user`.
  Default is unset. Required if a password is set for the role, and not using
  "trust" authentication.

Use the `psql` command to connect to `postgres` and create the specified role and
database. For example, to create a "superuser" role named `"kwild"` with the
password `"kwild"`, and a database called `"kwild"` owned by that role:

```sql
CREATE USER kwild WITH PASSWORD 'kwild' SUPERUSER REPLICATION;
CREATE DATABASE kwild OWNER kwild;
```

:::warning
`kwild` currently requires a "superuser" role to perform various
tasks that require elevated privileges, such as creating triggers and
publications for logical replication. The `postgres` database cluster
should be dedicated to `kwild`, and should not be used for any other purpose.
:::

For more information about authentication configuration please see
the official [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).
