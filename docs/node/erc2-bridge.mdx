Starting Kwil v0.10, Kwil allows you to build EVM bridge that supports bridging ERC20 token from and to EVM compatible chains, without worrying about security and centralization risks.

ERC20 bridge also gives you the ability to programmely manage the ERC20 token using Kwil SQl contract, on Kwil, makes it suitable for many use cases:
- sell private data on Kwil
- use token to incentive user engaging in web2 product
- need to apply complex logic on token, frequently and cheap

In this page, we'll explain the mechanism, and we'll demonstrate how to use it.

## The mechanism

ERC20 bridge has three major components:
- Kwil erc20-bridge extension: providing interface for DEV to manage erc20 tokens in Kwil SQL contract
- GnosisSafe on EVM chains + signer in kwild: multi sign infra; kwild can be configured as a signer for GnosisSafe wallet
- Escrow smart contract on EVM chains: manages ERC20 tokens on EVM chain

and all components are decentralized out of the box.

### Bridge ERC20 token from EVM chain to Kwil

To bridge tokens to Kwil, you only need to transfer the ERC20 token to the Escrow contract.

Kwil's oracle extension monitors the transfer event of the target ERC20 token.
When Escrow contract receives tokens from a wallet, the same wallet will be credited the same amount of token on Kwil.

### Bridge ERC20 token from Kwil to EVM chain

To bridge token to EVM chains, you need to go through the following steps:
- issue token to a wallet using erc20-bridge extension
- the multi-sign parties see the issuance, they verify and sign the approval
- providing enough signatures, any party then can post that issuance onto EVM chain, through GnosisSafe
- the recipient then can go ahead to withdraw token out of the Escrow contract


## An USDC giveaway example

Let's create a simple example on Kwil to give away Sepolia USDC on Kwil.

Here is how this APP works:
- our APP will have a kwil action called `gm`
- anyone can call this action, and get 0.1 Sepolia USDC on very call

Let's assume we've deployed GnosisSafe and Escrow contract on Sepolia testnet, and the Escrow address is `0x0000000000000000000000000000beef`, and it manages USDC token.
And the GnosisSafe setting is 1/x.

Let's build it.

### Config kwild to enable erc20-bridge

To enable erc20-bridge, you need to config erc20_bridge section in your kwild config.

```toml
# ERC20 bridge configuration
[erc20_bridge]
# evm websocket RPC; format: chain_name='rpc_url'
[erc20_bridge.rpc]
sepolia = "wss://YOUR_ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_PROVIDER"

# rpc option block sync chunk size; format: chain_name='chunk_size'
[erc20_bridge.block_sync_chuck_size]
seoplia = "1000000"

# signer service configuration; format: ext_alias='file_path_to_private_key'
[erc20_bridge.signer]
usdc = "/path/to/your/privatekey"
```

The configuration tells kwild:
- there is RPC for sepolia
- and for sepolia, the block_sync_chunk_size is 1000000;
- and for the bridge signer, use `/path/to/your/privatekey` as the private key for erc20 bridge `usdc`;  this also tells kwild that we'll be a Signer of our GnosisSafe wallet, so make sure you're using the right private key.

We'll find out why we configured `usdc` in next section.

### Bridge USDC to Kwil

First, we tell Kwil that we have an escrow contract on Sepolia testnet, and we want to bridge the erc20 token it manages;
every 10 minutes, an epoch should be created so that all the tokens issued on Kwil can be bridged back to Sepolia testnet; and our new bridge is called usdc.

```
kwil-cli exec-sql "
USE erc20 {
    chain: 'sepolia',
    escrow: '0x0000000000000000000000000000beef',
    distribution_period: '10m'
} AS usdc;" --sync
```

Then, as the project owner, we need to fund our APP. we transfer some USDC on sepolia to `0x0000000000000000000000000000beef`.
Kwil oracle will see this and credit same amount of token to your account on Kwil.

Lastly, after we transfer, and wait a bit, you can check your balance on Kwil, by doing

```
kwil-cli call-action balance -n usdc text:YOUR_ETH_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

If you see non-zero balance, congratulation, we bridged USDC to Kwil!

### Define our USDC giveaway app

Our APP can be defined as:

```
CREATE NAMESPACE IF NOT EXISTS usdc_giveaway;

{usdc_giveaway}CREATE ACTION gm() public {
    usdc.issue(@caller, usdc.scale_up('0.1'));
};
```

The code above does this:
- First, we put our APP in  namespace `usdc_giveaway`
- Second, we create an action `gm` to issue 0.01 USDC token to `@caller`;

> NOTE: 'Builtin functions' section explains `issue` and `scale_up` function.


Save this to `/tmp/giveaway.sql`, then execute it: `kwil-cli exec-sql -f /tmp/giveaway.sql --sync`

### Let's give away some money

Now let's use another user to grab some money.

After you configure a new user, do `kwil-cli exec-action gm -n usdc_giveaway --sync`.

After about 10 minutes or so, you can check if you have tokens you can claim on Sepolia testnet:
`kwil-cli call-action list_wallet_rewards -n rewards text:YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS --sync`.

> NOTE: the output of this command will display BYTEA column as base64.


### Claim our USDC on Sepolia testnet

From the output of `kwil-cli call-action list_wallet_rewards -n rewards text:YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS --sync`, there are few
columns starts with `param_`, those are the correspond value you're supposed to use to claim token.

Now, let's open this `https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000beef#writeContract` in the browser, click `claimReward`,
then you'll see 6 inputs, which correspond to our `param_` column, you can use those value to claim your token.
