description: How to deploy a production network of remote nodes
slug: /node/production
---

This page illustrates the process of deploying a new production network comprising multiple independent nodes.

## Overview

The [Tutorial page](/docs/node/tutorial) illustrates the process of creating a new network of nodes by running each one on a single development machine.
While that is a quick and concise demonstration of how nodes interact and the validator management process, a real production network requires the
deployment of nodes on different host machines that typically operate in remote locations. This page demonstrates the deployment of such a network,
with attention to the relevant settings and considerations in such a setting.

## Concepts

There are several important concepts to understand when creating a network of independent remote nodes.

### Peers and Node IDs

Every Kwil node has a "node ID" that is includes the node's public key and network address. This plays an important role creating secure authenticated connections
between nodes over the internet.

A peer is always specified in the format `<public key>#<key type>@<IP address>:<port>`.  For example, given a node with public
key `02977e1f9bcec8c1b1905cf45cc5cfcfbabf9ca579d42d1b1a228e9b0f1c6adecb` and key type `secp256k1` that is reachable at IP address `10.1.2.3`
on TCP port `6600`, the notation used to specify this node as a peer is `02977e1f9bcec8c1b1905cf45cc5cfcfbabf9ca579d42d1b1a228e9b0f1c6adecb#secp256k1@10.1.2.3:6600`.

:::tip
An operator can determine their node ID in different ways:

1. Use the `kwild key info` command, which derives and displays the node ID given the private key.
2. Use the `kwild admin status` command, which requests the node ID from the running node's admin RPC service.
3. Locate the node ID in the node logs. An info-level log entry with the message "NODE: This node is" contains the node identity (public key and key type) and all listening addresses

The node's public key is also displayed when the private key is initially generated with the `kwild key gen` subcommand.

:::

### Peer Exchange

In a healthy network, nodes have many peers to prevent single points of failure or unintended network partitions, and to support efficient
network gossip. The feature that facilitates this is called peer exchanges (PEX). This is also enabled by default with the `p2p.pex = true`
setting. Disable this setting only if a node must not share its peers with other nodes.

### Network Bootstrapping

There are two supported ways of bootstapping a node's connection to a network: specifying a "seed" node and "persistent" peers. Both may be used
in conjunction with [PEX](#peer-exchange). These are described below.

#### Boot Nodes

The simplest method, particularly for a small new network, is to list known peers to which the node should always attempt to connect. This is done
using the peer notation described above.

For example, to specify two remote peers to always connect to on startup, list them as follows:

```toml
[p2p]
bootnodes = "02ae12856a766c277842e1319fd7e450711b706ef90942e8ad5be9369e5d22817c#secp256k1@10.1.2.3:6600,02cace485e891cb5e5bd22b008986980791677f9f553fd3bb3f864e6b84e011cdb#secp256k1@10.6.7.8:6600"
```

This may also be specified on the command line with the `--p2p.bootnodes` option, which may be specified multiple times for each peer rather than a comma-separated list.

### Validators

While not a networking concept, it is important to understand the role of validators as it pertains to block production. The consensus
engine used by Kwil requires *greater than* 1/2 of validators to approve proposed blocks. Thus, if the network is not well connected and
validators are unable to communicate efficiently, block production may be slowed or even stopped in the case of a network partition.

Not all nodes in a network must be validators. Non-validator nodes called "sentry" nodes are typically created to function as RPC service
providers or just to support network health by relaying transactions, blocks, and misbehavior evidence.

### Compatible Versions

A final important concept is version compatibility. On a production network, it is important to only run nodes built from the same release
branch, such as the `release-v0.8` branch, or a release tag with the same `MAJOR.MINOR` version. Different patch versions are compatible,
but large releases that change the application's state machine logic cannot be run on the same network. For example, it is not possible to
run `v0.8.4` and `v0.9.1` on the same network. To update a network between such major releases, it is necessary to perform a [migration](/docs/node/migrations).

## Walkthrough

This section illustrates the process for launching a small network of independent remote nodes. It will begin with two validators at genesis,
followed by the addition of a sentry node using block sync, and finally the new node will become a validator.

### Deploying Genesis Nodes and Validators

Starting a network with a single validator is possible, however, we will demonstrate starting with two validators from genesis since this also
illustrates the consensus considerations described above in [Validators](#validators).

#### Generating Node Private Keys

:::warning
Securely generate and store private keys. Anyone in possession of a private key can imitate and act on behalf of a node. In the case of a
validator, this impacts the security of the network.
:::

Every node has a unique identity, which is determined by its private key. We will generate a private key using the `kwild key gen` command:

```sh
kwild key gen --key-file ./private_key.json
```

This will write a file named `private_key.json` in the current directory that contains the ed25519 private key for a new node. Each node **must**
have a different private key.

We can inspect the key using the `kwild key info` command as follows:

```sh
$ kwild key info --key-file ./private_key.json
Key type: secp256k1
Private key (hex): da1ad3ad3e80d200ff66beb6515360337f6e61f14ce958e5bda717fef5aad9f5
Public key (plain hex): 02d3575f74ffcdb17f781f003d42284a4d1adf271558d0417423b8372ec3f34750
```

The "Public key (plain hex)" and "Key type" value is used in the `genesis.json` file to specify the initial validator set as described in the next section.

#### Creating the Genesis Document

Before starting the first nodes, it is necessary is to create a genesis file for the new network. The file specifies the validator set at genesis,
initial account funding allocations, and other network parameters. All nodes must use the exact same `genesis.json` file since its parameters affect 
he consensus rules for the network.

Unlike the node quick start guide where all genesis validator keys are generated with the `kwild setup testnet` command run once on one machine,
we will create a genesis file with the `kwild setup genesis` command. This takes as input:

1. the plain hex *public* keys, key types, and power of each genesis validator (formatted as `name:pubkey:power`)
2. the "chain ID" string that is the new network's name
3. any other default parameter overrides

Consider we want to start a new network called **"prod-chain"** with two genesis validators:

```sh
$ kwild setup genesis \
  --validators "0277fb40d1b745c8f96f411ab57915e2df3bc86efde70f0e687f4273beb6708b82#secp256k1:1" \
  --validators "03b0eedfb09ac1e19fa6f5eb1d5ade53c120ef32d988e60bb40ab08133b573ba30#secp256k1:1" \
  --leader "0277fb40d1b745c8f96f411ab57915e2df3bc86efde70f0e687f4273beb6708b82#secp256k1" \
  --chain-id "prod-chain" --out ~/prod-chain
Created genesis.json file at /home/user/prod-chain/genesis.json
```

The resulting genesis file has the chain ID and validators customized, with default values for the rest of the document:

```json title="genesis.json"
{
  "chain_id": "prod-chain",
  "initial_height": 0,
  "validators": [
    {
      "pubkey": "0277fb40d1b745c8f96f411ab57915e2df3bc86efde70f0e687f4273beb6708b82",
      "type": "secp256k1",
      "power": 1
    },
    {
      "pubkey": "03b0eedfb09ac1e19fa6f5eb1d5ade53c120ef32d988e60bb40ab08133b573ba30",
      "type": "secp256k1",
      "power": 1
    }
  ],
  "migration": {
    "start_height": 0,
    "end_height": 0
  },
  "leader": {
    "type": "secp256k1",
    "key": "0277fb40d1b745c8f96f411ab57915e2df3bc86efde70f0e687f4273beb6708b82"
  },
  "db_owner": "0277fb40d1b745c8f96f411ab57915e2df3bc86efde70f0e687f4273beb6708b82",
  "max_block_size": 6291456,
  "join_expiry": "24h0m0s",
  "disabled_gas_costs": true,
  "max_votes_per_tx": 200,
  "migration_status": "NoActiveMigration"
}
```

Provide this **same** `genesis.json` file to all node operators. The genesis file with the initial validators will remain the same for the entire lifetime of the network, even as the network adds new validators.

#### Node Configuration

Unlike `genesis.json`, which contains network-wide settings, the `config.toml` file is used to configure a Kwil node for its own purpose and network configuration. Create the `config.toml` file for each node separately, setting the listen addresses, external address, persistent peers, and seeds as appropriate for the node.

The `kwil-admin setup init` command is used to initialize a node's "root" directory, which by default is `~/.kwild`. We will use the agreed upon genesis file using the `--genesis` flag. Since these are genesis validators, we must also copy the `private_key` file that we manually generated for each node above into the created root directory (rather than the private key that is generated by the `setup init` command). Other nodes that are not validators specified in `genesis.json` may use the private key that is generated by the `setup init` command.

Consider we have prepared the keys and addresses for the two nodes described above as follows:

|                  | node0                                                                          | node1                                                                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| external IP      | `23.45.67.89`                                                                  | `98.76.54.32`                                                                  |
| node ID          | `0277fb40d1b745c8f96f411ab57915e2df3bc86efde70f0e687f4273beb6708b82#secp256k1` | `03b0eedfb09ac1e19fa6f5eb1d5ade53c120ef32d988e60bb40ab08133b573ba30#secp256k1` |

To have them connect to each other, we will set their `persistent_peer` settings appropriately.

On `node0`, we can initialize the root directory and the `config.toml` there with the following command:

```sh title="node0"
[node0]:~$ kwild setup init --genesis prod-chain/genesis.json \
  --root /data/kwil-node0
Initialized node in /data/kwil-node0
```

Then copy the `private_key` file created previously for this node into the root directory.

On `node1`, do the same, but with `node0` as a bootnode

```sh title="node1"
[node1]:~$ kwild setup init --genesis prod-chain/genesis.json \
  --p2p.bootnodes "0277fb40d1b745c8f96f411ab57915e2df3bc86efde70f0e687f4273beb6708b82#secp256k1@23.45.67.89:6600" \
  --root /data/kwil-node1
Initialized node in /data/kwil-node1
```

Finally, copy this node's `private_key` file into the root directory.

#### Initial Startup and Block Production

Now that both of the validators have been prepared with the same `genesis.json` file and their persistent peer configurations pointing to each other, it is time to start the nodes.

:::tip
Depending on how the nodes are deployed, `kwild` would be run as a service, container, or in a terminal multiplexer.
:::

##### Postgres Database

Install Postgres create a `kwild` database on each node. Refer to the [Postgres setup guide](/docs/daemon/running-postgres) for more information and quick start instructions.

##### Start Kwild

Start the nodes on each of the remote machines, specifying the path to the root directory if it is not at the default location (`~/.kwild`):

```sh title="node0"
[node0]:~$ kwild start -r /data/kwil-node0
```

```sh title="node1"
[node1]:~$ kwild start -r /data/kwil-node1
```

Once the nodes connect, the first block will be produced shortly after:

```plain
2025-01-27 18:46:01.558 [INF] CONS: Executed block {height=1 blkID=31b73d85af0ece994263f8b9622f31425c116ea34a5ddd0113535e6b34b4de90 numTxs=0 appHash=2d8f3ceeff2c836527da823d7b654d33d3e44b6159b172235c160001e0c9b4db}
2025-01-27 18:46:01.559 [INF] CONS: Majority of the validators have accepted the block, proceeding to commit the block {height=1 hash=31b73d85af0ece994263f8b9622f31425c116ea34a5ddd0113535e6b34b4de90 acks=1 nacks=0}
```

Recall that *both* of the validators need to be started and able to communicate before blocks can be created, as discussed in the
[Validators section](#validators). If the nodes are unable to connect, look for peer-related errors in the logs, and check your persistent
peers settings and firewall rules.

### Adding a New Node

Now that our network of two validators is running and producing blocks, we will create and synchronize a new node to the network, and once
it is synchronized, promote the node to a validator.

#### Starting as a Sentry Node

Now we will add a third note to the network as a sentry node. Since this node is not a genesis validator, its public key is not included
in the genesis file, which is now immutable. The `kwild setup init` command can be used to simultaneously initialize a new node's root
directory and generate a new private key.

:::important
When adding a node to the network, start it as a non-validator / sentry node.
Always completely synchronize the node to the network before attempting to promote it to a validator.
:::

Like before, we will specify the location of the network's `genesis.json` file, the host's external IP address, and one or more persistent
peers. However, we will use the generated private key:

```sh title="node2"
[node2]:~$ kwild setup init --genesis prod-chain/genesis.json \
  --p2p.bootnodes "0277fb40d1b745c8f96f411ab57915e2df3bc86efde70f0e687f4273beb6708b82#secp256k1@23.45.67.89:6600" \
  --root /data/kwil-node2
Initialized node in /data/kwil-node2
```

We can see the ID of `node2` before starting it:

```sh title="node2"
[node2]:~$ kwild key info --key-file /data/kwil-node2/private_key | grep "Node ID"
Node ID: 03dbe22b9922b5c0f8f60c230446feaa1c132a93caa9dae83b5d4fab16c3404a22#secp256k1
```

#### Verifying Successful Node Synchronization

Before adding the node as a validator, ensure that `node2` has completely synchronized with the network. You can do this with either the `kwil-admin` tool, or with the public user service using `kwil-cli`.

Using `kwild admin status`, inspect the `.sync.best_block_height` and `.sync.syncing` values:

```sh title="node2"
[node2]:~$ kwild node status
{
  "node": {
    "chain_id": "kwil-test-chain",
    "node_id": "03dbe22b9922b5c0f8f60c230446feaa1c132a93caa9dae83b5d4fab16c3404a22#secp256k1",
    "app_ver": 1,
    "listen_addr": "127.0.0.1:6600",
    "role": "validator",
    "rpc_addr": "/tmp/admin.sock"
  },
  "sync": {
    "app_hash": "537935ed434a25f23bfb18324b36ba1936e8be5d0df1a330eab413d848304d96",
    "best_block_hash": "9a38b3c78d2a4361c7615db779f8beb073b46819bb275295716283d2c700a6ac",
    "best_block_height": 337,
    "best_block_time": "2025-01-27T18:45:00.199-06:00",
    "syncing": false
  },
  "validator": {
    "pubkey": "03dbe22b9922b5c0f8f60c230446feaa1c132a93caa9dae83b5d4fab16c3404a22",
    "type": "secp256k1",
    "power": 1
  }
}
```

Ensure that the node is no longer syncing (catching up) with the network and that the best block height is within a couple blocks of the network's known height.

Use `kwil-cli utils chain-info` to query the height of any node with its RPC service exposed:

```sh
$ kwil-cli utils chain-info --provider "http://98.76.54.32:8484"
Chain ID: prod-chain
Height: 109
Hash: 1d5a4ef85927dce3c90168e89fdfb32219c5c95bb5ed3332eb69e20bbe7346da
```

Compare the output of that command with the result from `node2` to ensure the new node stays in sync with the network as new blocks are produced.

Alternatively, check the new node's health check REST endpoint, which will return an HTTP status code of 200 and a JSON body with `"healthy":true` if the node is ready:

```sh title="node2"
[node2]:~$ curl -s --fail http://127.0.0.1:8484/api/v1/health
{"kwil_alive":true,"healthy":true, ...}
```

#### Joining the Validator Set

Unlike `node0` and `node1`, consensus does not require participation from `node2`, which just executes the blocks that are produced and approved by the validators. In this section we will add `node2` to the validator set.

Start by submitting a validator "join" request from `node2`:

```sh title="node2"
[node2]:~$ kwil-admin validators join 
TxHash: 0722630c4296ea27d77f4ee8db6129c1ca042372811187f7ba787c75464400ed
```

We have now submitted a request to become a validator, which the existing validators must approve for this node to join the validator set. The `validators list-join-requests` subcommand from any node can view this request:

```sh
$ kwil-admin validators list-join-requests
Pending join requests (1 approval needed):
 Candidate                                                                    | Power | Approvals | Expiration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------+-----------+------------
 03dbe22b9922b5c0f8f60c230446feaa1c132a93caa9dae83b5d4fab16c3404a22#secp256k1 |     1 |         0 | 14627
```

Both validators are required to approve this request since 1/2 does not meet the threshold of greater than 2/3 of the validators. This is done by running the following on **each validator**:

```sh
$ kwil-admin validators approve 03dbe22b9922b5c0f8f60c230446feaa1c132a93caa9dae83b5d4fab16c3404a22#secp256k1
TxHash: cab4b66d12cd6ecee256ba73dd9500a3ea7b21ba03bd38d5db7701268a0f8ecb
```

Once the approval transactions are mined, `node2` will become part of the validator set:

```sh
$ kwil-admin validators list
Current validator set:
  0. {pubkey = 0277fb40d1b745c8f96f411ab57915e2df3bc86efde70f0e687f4273beb6708b82#secp256k1, power = 1}
  1. {pubkey = 03b0eedfb09ac1e19fa6f5eb1d5ade53c120ef32d988e60bb40ab08133b573ba30#secp256k1, power = 1}
  2. {pubkey = 03dbe22b9922b5c0f8f60c230446feaa1c132a93caa9dae83b5d4fab16c3404a22#secp256k1, power = 1}
```

The node is now a validator.  Keep it running and [monitor its health](#verifying-successful-node-synchronization).
