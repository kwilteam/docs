Offline migrations make use of network snapshots to migrate the state from an existing network to a new network. This method requires the validators to coordinate and take the network offline for a short period of time to upgrade the network. The network snapshot is used to bootstrap the new network with the same state as the existing network at the time of the snapshot. This method is simple and requires minimal coordination among the validators.

Refer below for detailed information on upgrading the network using offline migrations.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
