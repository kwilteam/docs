This tutorial demonstrates how to ugrade a network using zero-downtime migrations. This tutorial has 4 parts:

1. Creating The Migration Proposal
2. Approving The Migration Proposal
3. Setting Up The New Nodes
4. Running Both Networks In Parallel

# 1. Creating The Migration Proposal

To migrate the network, more than 2/3 of the validators need to agree to the migration. Therefore, the first step is to use the `kwil-admin migrate propose`
command to create a migration proposal. Other nodes will be able to see this proposal and vote on it. A proposal has 2 parameters:

- `ActivationPeriod`: The number of blocks in between when enough nodes have voted to proceed with the migration, and when the migration actually begins. This
gives node operators time to set up their new nodes. We will use 100 blocks in this example.
- `Duration`: The number of blocks that the migration will take. This is the time that the both the new and old network will run in parallel. We will use
2000 blocks in this example.

```shell
kwil-admin migrate propose --activation-period 100 --duration 2000
```

To ensure that the proposal was submitted successfully, you can check the list of pending migration proposals:

```shell
# NOTE: If you are running a single node network, you won't see any migrations in this list.
# Proposed migrationa are automatically approved by the authoring validator. Therefore if
# you are the only validator, the migration is automatically approved.
$ kwil-admin migrate list
4b0d1ad8-f9a5-5252-97e6-387d47b1ee9e:
        activationPeriod: 100
        migrationDuration: 2000
```

# 2. Approving The Migration Proposal

Now that the migration proposal exists, >2/3 of the validators need to approve it. Node operators can use the `kwil-admin migrate approve` command to approve
the migration proposal. The command requires the proposal ID as an argument. In this example, the proposal ID is `4b0d1ad8-f9a5-5252-97e6-387d47b1ee9e`.

```shell
kwil-admin migrate approve 4b0d1ad8-f9a5-5252-97e6-387d47b1ee9e
```

To see which validators have already approved a proposal, and which have not, you can use the `kwil-admin migrate proposal-status` command. This command also requires
the proposal ID as an argument.

```shell
$ kwil-admin migrate proposal-status 4b0d1ad8-f9a5-5252-97e6-387d47b1ee9e
Migration Status:
        Proposal ID: 4b0d1ad8-f9a5-5252-97e6-387d47b1ee9e
        ExpiresAt: 100810
        Approvals Received: 2 (needed 3)
                Validator 8b90c1a6c017eb42f3c8496524bb186a1900b8b832309713e797d7f5defdccec: (approved)
                Validator 594e07489b13bfcae681482423dc4327a2f99601f74b7be785501f1dd3c022be: (approved)
                Validator 6d28361677bfe61fe86f3dd4457e069dfba57f912a5c01d554de528766f8a1c3: (not approved)
                Validator b7404d70ae6f21b9f43d26fde6acc378be51c170a9744cb08634b6bdae22e1d2: (not approved)
```

Once the migration has been approved by >2/3 of the validators, the activation period will begin. You can check its status using the
`kwil-admin migrate network-status` command:

```shell
$ kwil-admin migrate network-status
Migration Status: ActivationPeriod
        Start Height: 80000
        End Height: 82000
        Current Block: 79950
```

# 3. Setting Up The New Nodes

Once the activation period has begun, node operators can start setting up their new nodes. This will require you to create and distributes a new genesis file
for the new network. Each node will complete the genesis file with the genesis state, validator set, initial height, and other information once the activation
period has ended. Use the `kwil-admin setup genesis` command to create a genesis file that can be used with migrations. This will be generated at `./genesis.json`.

```shell
kwil-admin setup genesis --chain-id kwil-chain-2
```

To set up our new node, use the `kwil-admin setup init` command with the new genesis file. Each node operator will need to run this command on their new node.
**New nodes should be run on a different machine than the old node.**

```shell
kwil-admin setup init --genesis /path/to/genesis.json
```

Run the migration node, and point it at the RPC endpoint of the old node. The new node will use this RPC endpoint to sync data from the old network.

```shell
kwild --migration.enable --migration.from http://old-node-rpc:8484
```

# 4. Verify Both Networks Are Running In Parallel

While new nodes are running during the activation period, they will enter a "migration mode", where they do not produce blocks. In this mode, they will poll
the old node for the genesis state of the new network. Once the activation period has ended, if >2/3 of the new nodes are running, the new network will start
producing blocks. The old network will continue to produce blocks, and changes on the old network will be reflected on the new network. Once the migration
duration has ended, the new network will stop syncing blocks from the old network, and the old network can be safely decommissioned.

To verify that a node is running in migration mode, search for a log resembling the following in the node's logs:

```shell
{"level":"info","ts":1727721906.8221178,"logger":"kwild","msg":"Entering migration mode","migrate_from":"http://old-rpc:8484"}
```

### Verify The New Network Is Syncing

To verify that the new network is syncing changes from the old network, you can use the `kwil-admin migrate network-status` command. When used on youe old node,
this command will tell you whether the new network is syncing or has finished. If the new network is syncing, you will see a message like the following:

```shell
$ kwil-admin migrate network-status
Genesis migration in progress.
```

Once the new network has finished syncing, you will see a message like the following:

```shell
$ kwil-admin migrate network-status
Genesis migration complete.
```
