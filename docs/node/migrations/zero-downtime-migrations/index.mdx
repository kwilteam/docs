In the scenarios where the network cannot afford any downtime, Zero Downtime Migrations are the best solution. This method involves launching a new network and running it in parallel with the existing network during the migration period and streaming changes from the existing network to the new network to keep the new network in sync with the existing network. At the end of the migration period, the old network can be decommissioned without any disruption to the network's users or services.
