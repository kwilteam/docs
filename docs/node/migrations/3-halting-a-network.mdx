Networks may find it desirable to halt a network at a specific block height to perform maintenance or upgrades. This page provides a guide on how to gracefully
halt a Kwil network at a height agreed upon by the validators.

## Halt an Existing Network

In order to halt a running network, >=1/3 of the validators must agree to do so. The validators must agree on the block to halt at by modifying their local
`genesis.json` file to include the `halt` activation at the desired block height. The `halt` activation is a hard fork that will halt the network at the
specified block height.

For example, take the following `genesis.json`:

```json title="genesis.json"
{
  "genesis_time": "2024-09-30T19:14:28.153768Z",
  "chain_id": "my-kwil-chain",
  "initial_height": 1,
  "app_hash": null,
  "activations": null,
  "consensus_params": {
    "block": {
      "max_bytes": 6291456,
      "max_gas": -1,
      "abci_max_bytes": false
    },
    "evidence": {
      "max_age_num_blocks": 100000,
      "max_age_duration": 172800000000000,
      "max_bytes": 1048576
    },
    "version": {
      "app": 0
    },
    "validator": {
      "pub_key_types": [
        "ed25519"
      ],
      "join_expiry": 100800
    },
    "votes": {
      "vote_expiry": 14400,
      "max_votes_per_tx": 100
    },
  }
}
```

If we want to halt the network at height 1000, at least 1>3 of the validators must modify their `genesis.json` file to include the `halt` activation at
height 1000:

```json title="genesis.json"
{
  "genesis_time": "2024-09-30T19:14:28.153768Z",
  "chain_id": "my-kwil-chain",
  "initial_height": 1,
  "app_hash": null,
// highlight-next-line
  "activations": {
// highlight-next-line
    "halt": 1000
// highlight-next-line
  },
  "consensus_params": {
    "block": {
      "max_bytes": 6291456,
      "max_gas": -1,
      "abci_max_bytes": false
    },
    "evidence": {
      "max_age_num_blocks": 100000,
      "max_age_duration": 172800000000000,
      "max_bytes": 1048576
    },
    "version": {
      "app": 0
    },
    "validator": {
      "pub_key_types": [
        "ed25519"
      ],
      "join_expiry": 100800
    },
    "votes": {
      "vote_expiry": 14400,
      "max_votes_per_tx": 100
    },
  }
}
```
