---

Kwil features an [officially supported package](<https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-extensions>) for writing extensions in Go.  The Go package
contains functions for creating gRPC servers to be used in extensions.

## Installation

To install, run:

```bash
go get github.com/kwilteam/kwil-extensions/server
go get github.com/kwilteam/kwil-extensions/types
```

## Creating an Extension

### Building Extensions

This package provides an interface, ExtensionBuilder, for creating and managing extensions on a server. Extensions are primarily built by associating
them with specific methods that they should provide, and an initializer function that is called every time a new Kuneiform schema using the extension is deployed. It's also possible to
specify the name of the extension, and what should occur when a log is emitted from the server.

Below are the ExtensionBuilder interface's methods:

`WithMethods(map[string]MethodFunc)`: This method specifies the methods that the extension should provide. Each method is associated
with a function that executes the method.  **Method names are case insensitive.**

`WithInitializer(InitializeFunc)`: This method takes a function that will be called _each time_ a new Kuneiform schema containing the extension is
deployed.  It will also be called once for each Kuneiform schema that exists on a node when the node starts up.

`Named(string)`: This method specifies the name of the extension. The name is a case insensitive, unique identifier.

`WithLoggerFunc(LoggerFunc)`: This method specifies what should occur when a log is emitted. Logs are only emitted if there is a gRPC error.

`Build()`: This method creates the extension server. If there are any errors in the configuration, it will return an error.

### Extension Methods

A MethodFunc is a function that executes a method. It takes in an execution context and a variable number of scalar input values, and it returns a list of scalar output values or an error if something goes wrong.

Here is an example of how to define a MethodFunc:

```go
import "github.com/kwilteam/kwil-extensions/types"

func Sum(ctx *types.ExecutionContext, inputs ...*types.ScalarValue) ([]*types.ScalarValue, error) {
    // logic for summing inputs
}
```
You can use `WithInputsCheck(fn MethodFunc, numInputs int) MethodFunc` and `WithOutputsCheck(fn MethodFunc, numOutputs int) MethodFunc` helper functions to check the number of inputs and outputs respectively.
These functions will return a new `MethodFunc` that includes the checks.  If a method is called with the wrong number of inputs or outputs, it will return an error:

```go
import (
    "github.com/kwilteam/kwil-extensions/types"
    "github.com/kwilteam/kwil-extensions/server"
)

func Sum(ctx *types.ExecutionContext, inputs ...*types.ScalarValue) ([]*types.ScalarValue, error) {
    // logic for summing inputs
}

func main() {
        twoInputSum := server.WithInputsCheck(Sum, 2)

        _, err := twoInputSum(ctx, []*types.ScalarValue{types.NewScalarValue(1)})
        // err will be non-nil

        _, err := twoInputSum(ctx, []*types.ScalarValue{types.NewScalarValue(1), types.NewScalarValue(2)})
        // err will be nil
}
```

Using `WithInputsCheck` and `WithOutputsCheck` is a good practice to avoid and better debug unexpected runtime errors in your database.

### InitializeFunc

An InitializeFunc is a function that creates a new instance of an extension.  This is called each time a new Kuneiform schema containing the extension is deployed.
If a schema initializes an extension multiple times, it will be called each time.  It will also be called once for each Kuneiform schema that exists on a node when the node starts up.

The InitializeFunc receives a map of metadata passed from the client (these are the values used when importing and aliasing an extension).
The function is then able to verify, modify, or add to the map as needed.  The returned map will be included in every subsequent call to the extension
from that Kuneiform schema.

Here is an example of how to define an InitializeFunc:

```go
func initFunc(ctx context.Context, metadata map[string]string) (map[string]string, error) {
    // logic for initializing
}
```

### LoggerFunc

A LoggerFunc is a function that consumes logs from the Extension Server. It is specified using the
WithLoggerFunc method on the ExtensionBuilder interface. If not specified, logs will not be emitted by default.

Logs are only emitted from the server in the case of an error.

Here is an example of how to define a LoggerFunc:

```go
func logFunc(l string) {
    // logic for handling logs
}
```

## Example of Building an Extension

Below is an example of how to build a fully functional extension that provides a method called `sum` that sums two numbers.

```go
import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"net"
	"os"
	"os/signal"
	"syscall"

	"github.com/kwilteam/kwil-extensions/server"
	"github.com/kwilteam/kwil-extensions/types"
)

func Sum(ctx *types.ExecutionContext, inputs ...*types.ScalarValue) ([]*types.ScalarValue, error) {
	a, err := inputs[0].Int()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	b, err := inputs[1].Int()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	result, err := types.NewScalarValue(a + b)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return []*types.ScalarValue{result}, nil
}

var methods = map[string]server.MethodFunc{
	"sum": server.WithInputsCheck(Sum, 2),
}

var initFunc = func(ctx context.Context, metadata map[string]string) (map[string]string, error) {
	// Initialization logic
	return metadata, nil
}

var logFunc = func(l string) {
	log.Println(l)
}

func main() {
	// building the extension
	svr, err := server.Builder().
		WithMethods(methods).
		WithInitializer(initFunc).
		Named("calculator").
		WithLoggerFunc(logFunc).
		Build()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// adding listening address
	lis, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":50051")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to listen: %v", err)
	}

	// launch goroutine to serve extension
	go func() {
		log.Printf("listening on %s", ":50051")
		if err := svr.Serve(lis); err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("failed to serve: %v", err)
		}
	}()

	// listen for shutdown signal
	quit := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(quit, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)
	<-quit

	log.Printf("\nshutting down")

	// gracefully shutdown extension server
	err = svr.GracefulStop()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to shutdown extension server: %v", err)
	}

	log.Printf("shutdown complete")
}
```

### Using the Extension

To import this extension in Kuneiform, you would use the following syntax:

```typescript
use calculator {} as my_calc;
```

To use this extension within an action:

```typescript
action sum_action($val1, $val2) public {
    $result = my_calc.sum($val1, $val2);
    // rest of action
}
```
