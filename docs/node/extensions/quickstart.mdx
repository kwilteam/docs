This page containse a step-by-step guide for how to build and compile a Kwil extension into a single Kwil binary.  It will walk through the following steps:

1. Creating an action extension that sums two numbers
2. Compiling the extension into a Kwil binary
3. Running the Kwil binary to start a Kwil node with the extension

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation)
- Export `GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

## Creating an Action Extension

All extensions are written and Go and compiled with the rest of the Kwil codebase. 

If you have not done so already, fork the `kwilteam/kwil-db` repository and create a new directory in the `extensions` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db.git
cd kwil-db
task tools # if you haven't already installed kwil-db dependencies
mkdir extensions/sum
```

In the new directory, paste the example code from the [Action Extensions Example](/docs/extensions/actions/Tutorial#step-2-create-the-action-extension) into a new file called `sum.go`, or write your own extension.

Your extension should look something like this:

```go title="extensions/sum/sum.go"
package sum

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/YOUR_ORG_NAME/kwil-db/common"
    "github.com/YOUR_ORG_NAME/kwil-db/extensions/actions"
)

// name of the extension
const name = "sumext"

... // the rest of the extension code
```

## Compiling the Extension

To ensure that the extension is included in the compiled Kwil binary, you must import the extension into the `extensions/register.go` file. Add the following line to the `import` section of the file.

Make sure to replace `YOUR_ORG_NAME` with your GitHub username or organization name you cloned the repository under.

```go title="extensions/registry.go"
package extensions

// replace below with your extension path
import _ "github.com/kwilteam/YOUR_ORG_NAME/extensions/sum" 
```

:::tip
For other types of extensions (e.g. authentication, oracle, resolution), you will also import the extension into this same `register.go` file.
:::

Next, compile the Kwil binary with the build command:

```bash
task build
```

The binary will be compiled and saved in the `.build` directory.

:::note
The build may fail if you have not installed the necessary dependencies. If this happens, run `task tools`, ensure that $GOPATH/bin is in your PATH, and try again.
:::

## Running the Kwil Binary

Running the newly compiled binary is the same as running and Kwil Binary.

### Start Postgres in Docker

Start Postgres from the kwil-db repository root:

```bash
docker compose -f ./deployments/compose/postgres/docker-compose.yml up
```

### Start the Kwil Node

```bash
.build/kwild --autogen --app.pg_db_host localhost
```

The Kwil node will start with the extension included!

## Conclusion

You have successfully created and compiled a Kwil action extension! This process follows the same pattern for all extensions, so you can use this guide to create any type of extension you need.
