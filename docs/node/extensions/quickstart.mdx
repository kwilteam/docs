This page contains a step-by-step guide for creating and using your first Kwil extension.  It will walk through the following steps:

1. Creating a valid Kwil Extension
2. Creating a Docker Image for the Extension
3. Using Docker Compose to run the extension with Kwil

**You will need to install [Docker](<https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/>) and [log in](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/>) to complete this guide.**

## Creating a valid Kwil Extension

Kwil currently supports libraries for building extensions in both [TypeScript/JavaScript](./packages/javascript.mdx) and [Golang](./packages/golang.mdx).

We will use either of these libraries to create a gRPC server that can be used as a Kwil extension.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript / JavaScript" default>

To build an extension server in TypeScript/JavaScript, we will be referencing the example found [here](./packages/javascript.mdx).

### Initalize Repository

Create a new repository and install the `kwil-extensions` package:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install kwil-extensions
npm install -D ts-node
```

### Implementing the Extension

To create a valid extension server:

1. Create a file called `index.js` or `index.ts`
2. Paste the example code from the [JavaScript Extension Example](./packages/js-ts#example-of-building-an-extenstion) into the file, or write your own extension.

To test that it is working properly, run:

```bash
ts-node index.ts
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="golang" label="Golang">

To build an extension server in Golang, we will be referencing the example found [here](./packages/golang.mdx)

### Creating the go.mod

Create a new repository and run the following command to create a new go.mod file:

```bash
go mod init github.com/<your_github_username>/<repository_name>
```
    
### Implementing the Extension

To create a valid extension server:

1. Create a file called `main.go`
2. Paste the example code from the [Golang Extension Example](./packages/golang.mdx#example-of-building-an-extension) into the file, or write your own extension.

To test that it is working properly, run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Creating a Docker Image

To create a Docker image for your extension, you will need to create a Dockerfile in the root of your repository.  This process will be slightly different
depending on whether you are using TypeScript/JavaScript or Golang.

In the root directory of your application, create a file called `Dockerfile` and paste the following:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript / JavaScript" default>

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
# First stage: build the application
FROM node:14

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the source from the current directory to the working directory inside the container
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Expose port
EXPOSE 50051

# Command to run the application
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="golang" label="Go">

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
# First stage: build the application
FROM golang:1.20 AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy go mod and sum files
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Download all dependencies
RUN go mod download

# Copy the source from the current directory to the working directory inside the container
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o main .

# Second stage: create the Docker image
FROM alpine:latest

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /root/

# Copy the binary from the first stage
COPY --from=builder /app/main .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 50051

# Command to run the application
CMD ["./main"]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now that you have a Dockerfile, you can build the image by running:

```bash
docker build -t my-extension-name .
```

## Running the Extension with Kwil using Docker Compose

Now that you have built your extension as a Docker image, you can run it with Kwil using Docker Compose.

To do this, we will be using the [Kwil extension deployment template](<https://github.com/kwilteam/extension-deployment-template>):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kwilteam/extension-deployment-template.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, open the `docker-compose.yaml`.  Under `services:extensions-1:name`, replace "<your_image_here>" with the name of your Docker image:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
version: '3'
services:
  extension-1:
    image: <your_image_here>
    ports:
      - 50055:50051
    restart: on-failure
```

Now, simply use the Makefile to download Kwil and run both Kwil and your extension. This will make the database accessible on http://localhost:8080.

```bash
make download-and-run
```

:::tip

To access the KwilProvider https://localhost:8080 in browser from the Kuneiform IDE, you may need to disable some browser security protections. 

For Brave Browser, disable the shields for ide.kwil.com by clicking the lion icon in the top right corner of the browser.

:::

**And that's it!**  You have successfully shipped your first Kwil extension alongside a Kwil database!
