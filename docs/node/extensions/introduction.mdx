description: An introduction to building and using extensions in Kwil.

Extensions are designed to allow developers to customize their Kwil network to fit their specific use case. Rather than having to fork the entire Kwil codebase, developers can simply build an extension to add the desired functionality.

Extensions are written in Golang and compiled with the rest of the Kwil codebase into a single binary.

There are four types of extensions that can be implemented:

1. **Action Extensions** - Action extensions allow developers to run arbitrary logic with each action that is performed on a Kwil database. Action extensions are called in [Kuneiform](/docs/category/kuneiform), Kwil's smart contract language.

2. **Authentication Extensions** - Authentication extensions allow developers to add additional digital signature schemes to their Kwil network. By default, Kwil supports secp256k1 and ed25519. Developers can add additional signature schemes such as RSA, NEP413, etc.

3. **Oracle Extensions** - Oracle extensions allow nodes to read and agree on data from external systems (e.g.checking a user's balance on another blockchain or checking a user's access level in an external system).

4. **Resolution Extensions** - Resolution extensions allow nodes to agree to execute a state changes on the Kwil Network (e.g. adjusting a balance, adjusting validator power, editing the database, etc). Resolution extensions are usually used in conjunction with oracle extensions (e.g. a user's balance on another blockchain is checked, and then a resolution extension is used to adjust the user's balance on Kwil).

Extensions are currently in alpha, and are subject to change.  **We are actively looking for feedback on the extensions system.**

## Getting Started

To get started using extensions, check out one of the following resources:

- [Building Extensions Overview / Tutorial](/docs/extensions/quickstart)
- Extension Overviews:
    - [Action Extensions](/docs/extensions/actions/overview)
    - [Authentication Extensions](/docs/extensions/authentication/overview)
    - [Oracle Extensions Overview](/extensions/oracle-extensions)
    - [Resolution Extensions Overview](/extensions/resolution-extensions)

### Examples

1. **Action: Credit Score Calcuation** - Developers can build an extension that calculates a user's credit score based on their data on the Kwil network, and then writes the data back to the database.

2. **Authentication: DB compatibility with Ethereum, Solana, and Arweave** - Developers can build an extension that allows users to sign with wallets from multiple ecosystems (e.g. Ethereum, Arweave, Solana, NEAR, etc).

3. **Oracle: Agreeing on validator stake in Ethereum Smart Contract** - Developers can build an extension that agrees on the amount of stake a validator has in an Ethereum smart contract.

4. **Resolution: Adjusting validator power** - Developers can build an extension that adjusts the power of a Kwil validator based on some external data (e.g. the amount of stake a validator has in an Ethereum smart contract).
