To use an action extension in Kuneiform, the Kwil node you are using must have been compiled with the extension.

To learn how to compile a Kwil node with an extension, refer to the [extension build quickstart](/docs/extensions/quickstart) guide.

## Example

As an example, we will refer to a hypothetical `hello_world` extension. This extension has one method, `sayHello`, which takes a string as an argument and returns a string.

## Importing The Extension

To import an extension in a Kuneiform schema, you need to use its declared name (which is defined in the extension itself).  With this, you can pass any initialization values, as well
as an alias for this instance of the extension.

```typescript
use hello_world {
    greeting: "Good afternoon, "
} as good_afternoon;
```

The same extension can be imported several times:

```typescript
use hello_world {
    greeting: "Good afternoon, "
} as good_afternoon;

use hello_world as default_hello;
```

## Calling Methods

To call a method on an extension, you need to use the alias you gave it when importing it.  You can then call the desired method, and pass any arguments it requires:

```typescript
action insert_good_afternoon($id, $name) public {
    $message = good_afternoon.sayHello($name);
    // stores "Good afternoon, $name" in the database
    INSERT INTO greetings (id, message) VALUES ($id, $message);
}

action insert_default_hello($id, $name) public {
    $message = default_hello.sayHello($name);
    // stores "Hello, $name" in the database
    INSERT INTO greetings (id, message) VALUES ($id, $message);
}
```

The above actions will call the `sayHello` method on the `good_afternoon` and `default_hello` extensions, passing the `$name` variable as the first argument.  The result of these calls will be stored in the `$message` variable, and can be used in the rest of the action.

:::tip
The reason why `good_afteroon` and `default_hello` provide different messages is because they were initialized with different values. This logic for this is in the extensions original [`ExtensionInitializer`](/docs/extensions/actions/overview#extensioninitializer) function.

## Full Schema

Below is a full example of a Kuneiform schema that uses the above hypothetical `hello_world` extension:

```typescript
database hello_world;

use hello_world {
    greeting: "Good afternoon, "
} as good_afternoon;

use hello_world as default_hello;

table greetings {
    id int primary,
    message text
}

action insert_good_afternoon($id, $name) public {
    $message = good_afternoon.sayHello($name);
    // stores "Good afternoon, $name" in the database
    INSERT INTO greetings (id, message) VALUES ($id, $message);
}

action insert_default_hello($id, $name) public {
    $message = default_hello.sayHello($name);
    // stores "Hello, $name" in the database
    INSERT INTO greetings (id, message) VALUES ($id, $message);
}
```
