Very simply, extensions are gRPC servers that have 4 rpc methods (not to be confused with the arbitrary methods that the extension provides):

- `Name` - Returns the name of the extension.  This name is used when importing the extension into a Kuneiform schema.
- `ListMethods` - Returns a list of usable extensions methods that the extension implements.
- `Execute` - Executes a method on the extension.  This is called from within a Kuneiform action.
- `Initialize` - Initializes a new instance of the extension.  This occurs once each time a Kuneiform schema using the extension is deployed (or when the Kwil daemon is rebooted).

The protobuf interface for Kwil extensions can be found [here](<https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-extensions/blob/main/proto/extension.proto>):

```javascript
service ExtensionService {
    // Name is used to get the name of the extension.
    rpc Name(NameRequest) returns (NameResponse) {}

    // ListMethods is used to list the methods which the extension provides.
    rpc ListMethods(ListMethodsRequest) returns (ListMethodsResponse) {}

    // Execute is used to execute a method provided by the extension.
    rpc Execute(ExecuteRequest) returns (ExecuteResponse) {}

    // Initialize is used to create a new extension instance
    rpc Initialize(InitializeRequest) returns (InitializeResponse) {}
}
```

## When Extensions are Used

Extensions can be used when deploying your own dedicated Kwil network / daemon.  This can be conceptually thought of as a very particular type of app-chain,
except the app-chain logic (within the extension) should be stateless and deterministic, as all state is handled by the SQL database.

While extensions can be run as distributed infrastructure, **it is recommended to run them as containerized sidecars**. Running them as sidecars helps prevent
transient errors that can occur when running them as distributed infrastructure.  Containerization forces extensions to run with sandboxed resources, preventing
them from crashing the daemon (which can cause database corruption).

## Initialization

When a new Kuneiform schema is deployed, it calls the provided `Initialize` method on each extension it imports, for each time it is imported.  This creates a
new extension "instance"; essentially, a connection to the extension with its own metadata.  This allows the same extension to be used any number of times.

The `Initialize` method takes a map of initialization variables, and can validate, modify, or add to them.  The returned map is then included in every subsequent
request made by the Kuneiform schema to the extension.

### In Kuneiform

```sql
use <extension_name> {
    // metadata_key_1: 'metadata_value_1'
    // metadata_key_2: 'metadata_value_2'
    // ...
} as <extension_alias>;
```

The `initialize` function could then perform validation logic on the passed values, add additional variables to the metadata map, or fire off some other process.  If an error is
returned during the `initialize` function, it will cause the deployment of the Kuneiform schema to fail.

### Corresponding Typescript Implementation

```typescript
import { InitializeFn } from "@kwil/extensions";

const initialize: InitializeFn = async (metadata: Record<string, string>): Promise<Record<string, string>> => {
    // metadata = {
    //      metadata_key_1: metadata_value_1
    //      metadata_key_2: metadata_value_2
    // }
    // ...

    // here, you can validate, modify, or add to the metadata

    return metadata;
}
```

The map returned from the above function would be included in each subsequent message (shown in the next section).

## Methods

When an action using an extension is executed, the `Execute` method is called on the extension.  The `Execute` method takes the map of variables returned from the `Initialize` function, an array of scalar values (either strings or integers), and returns an array of scalar values.
**Methods should be case insensitive**.

### In Kuneiform

```typescript
action use_my_extension($input1) public {
    $returned_value_1, $returned_value_2 = extension_alias.method_name($input1, 'constant input');
    // ...
}
```

Below is the corresponding Typescript extension method.  The comments show how the inputs and outputs are mapped from the Kuneiform action to the extension method.

### Corresponding Typescript Implementation

```typescript
import { MethodFn } from "@kwil/extensions";

const method_name: MethodFn = async ({ metadata, inputs }) => {
    // metadata = {
    //      metadata_key_1: metadata_value_1
    //      metadata_key_2: metadata_value_2
    // }

    const input1 = inputs[0]?.toNumber();
    // input1 = $input1
    const input2 = inputs[1]?.toString();
    // input2 = 'constant input'`

    // business logic here
    // throwing an error will cause the calling action to fail


    return ["return_value_1", 2];
    // $returned_value_1 = "return_value_1"
    // $returned_value_2 = 2
}
```

Within a method, you have access to both the initialized metadata as well as the inputs provided by the action.  You can return any number
of scalar values (strings or ints).  If an error is thrown, it will rollback and end the action execution.
