This page describes the "private" RPC server mode that restricts access to
network data, facilitating data privacy.

## Overview 

This RPC service mode requires authenticated call requests, disables ad-hoc SQL
queries, and omits raw transaction data from transaction status queries.

:::warning

Private RPC mode should be used with peer filtering as described on the
[Private Networks page](/docs/node/private-networks), or with coordinated access control
applied across all nodes' P2P services (e.g. linked via VPN). Open access to a node's P2P
service makes all data available to any other Kwil node that can reach it.

:::

## Node Configuration

The `app.private_rpc` setting is used to enable the private RPC mode.  Enable it
in the `config.toml` file:

```toml
[app]

# Enforce data privacy: authenticate JSON-RPC call requests using challenge-based
# authentication. the node will only accept JSON-RPC requests that has a valid signed
# challenge response. This also disables ad hoc queries, and no raw transaction retrieval.
private_rpc = true
```

When enabled, `kwild` does the following:

1. "Call" requests must be signed, and contain a challenge provided by the RPC
   service for replay protection.
2. Ad-hoc SQL queries are disabled.
3. Transaction status responses omit verbose transaction details that would
   contain the transaction body where any user data may be present.

The RPC server may also be configured to control call challenge handling.
Challenges issued to clients expire after the duration specified by the
`app.challenge_expiry` setting. This may be shortened if clients provide signed
call requests quickly, or lengthened if interactive signing requires additional
time. The `app.challenge_rate_limit` setting controls the maximum frequency at
which a client (by IP address) is permitted to request call challenges. See the
node [config reference](/docs/daemon/config/settings) for details.

### Quickstart

To quickly enable private RPC mode, use the `--app.private-rpc` flag when starting `kwild`:

```shell
kwild --app.private-rpc
```

See the [Node Quickstart](/docs/node/quickstart) guide for more information.

## Client

For RPC clients to make call requests with servers running in private mode, the
call request must include a valid signature and a server-provided "challenge".
The client requests a "challenge", which it includes in the call request that is
signed with the user's private key for authentication.

:::note

The clients maintained by the Kwil team (Kwil CLI, kwil-js, and Kwil Go) will
automatically handle the challenge request authentication if the client is 
configured with a private key.
