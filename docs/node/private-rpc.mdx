This page describes the "private" RPC server mode that restricts access to
network data, facilitating data privacy.

## Overview 

This RPC service mode requires authenticated call requests, disables ad-hoc SQL
queries, and omits raw transaction data from transaction status queries.

:::warning

Private RPC mode should be used with peer filtering as described on the
[Private Networks page](/docs/node/private-networks), or with coordinated access control
all nodes' P2P services (e.g. linked via VPN). Open access to a node's P2P service
makes all data available to any other Kwil node that can reach it.

:::

## Configuration

The `app.private_rpc` setting is used to enable the private RPC mode.  Enable it
in the `config.toml` file:

```toml
[app]

# Enforce data privacy: authenticate JSON-RPC call requests using challenge-based
# authentication. the node will only accept JSON-RPC requests that has a valid signed
# challenge response. This also disables ad hoc queries, and no raw transaction retrieval.
private_rpc = true
```

When enabled, `kwild` does the following:

1. "Call" requests must be signed, and contain a challenge provided by the RPC
   service for replay protection.
2. Ad-hoc SQL queries are disabled.
3. Transaction status responses omit verbose transaction details that would
   contain the transaction body where any user data may be present.

## Client Requirements

For RPC clients to make call requests with servers running in private mode, the
call request must include a valid signature and a server-provided "challenge".
The client requests a "challenge", which it includes in the call request that is
signed with the user's private key for authentication. **The Kwil official
clients handle this automatically.**

With `kwil-cli`, provide the `--callauth` flag when calling an action or procedure:

```sh
kwil-cli database call --callauth <param:val> ...
```

If the client has been configured with a private key, this will automatically
handle the challenge request authentication described above.

The Go and JavaScript SDKs have similar behaviors.

## Advanced Server Configuration

```toml
# Time after which a "call" challenge expires.
challenge_expiry = "10s"

# Call challenge request rate limit per second per client IP.
challenge_rate_limit = 10.0
```
