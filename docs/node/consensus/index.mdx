The Roadrunner consensus algorithm is a proprietary consensus mechanism created by Kwil. Drawing inspiration from established consensus protocols such as Two-Phase Commit (2PC), RAFT, and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), the Roadrunner algorithm is specifically tailored for database systems. It is engineered to enhance throughput and minimize latency, making it highly efficient for database operations.
