This document provides an overview of the core data structures used in Kwil's consensus algorithm and how to interpret them.

## Block

A Kwil block consists of a header, transactions and the signature. 

| Field       | Type        | Description    |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Header      | [BlockHeader](#block-header) | Block header   |
| Txns        | Transaction | List of transactions included in the block |
| Signature   | []byte      | Signature of the block by the block proposer (leader) |

## Block Header

A BlockHeader contains metadata about the block, including its position in the blockchain, the previous block's hash, and other relevant information.

| Field             | Type        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version           | uint16      | Version of the block                                                        |
| Height            | int64       | Height of the block in the blockchain                                       |
| NumTxns           | uint32      | Number of transactions included in the block                                |
| PrevHash          | Hash        | Hash of the previous block                                                  |
| PrevAppHash       | Hash        | Application state hash from the execution of the previous block             |
| Timestamp         | time.Time   | Timestamp when the block was created                                        |
| MerkleRoot        | Hash        | Merkle tree reference to hash of all transactions included in the block            |
| ValidatorSetHash  | Hash        | Hash of the current validator set used in the current consensus round|
| NetworkParamsHash | Hash        | Hash of the network parameters for the block                                |
| NewLeader         | crypto.PublicKey | Public key of the new leader if changed using non-transaction based approaches      |

### Block Header Validation Rules








## CommitInfo

The CommitInfo includes the information about the commit of the block, such as the signatures of the validators agreeing to the block.

| Field            | Type          | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AppHash          | Hash          | Application state hash from the execution of the block                      |
| Votes            | []*[VoteInfo](#voteinfo)   | List of votes from validators                                               |
| ParamUpdates     | ParamUpdates  | Updates to the network parameters, if any                                   |
| ValidatorUpdates | []*Validator  | Updates to the validator set, if any                                        |

## VoteInfo

The VoteInfo represents the leader's interpretation of the AckRes vote received from the validator.

| Field       | Type        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AckStatus   | [AckStatus](#ackstatus)   | Status of the acknowledgment (Agree, Reject, Forked)                        |
| AppHash     | *Hash       | Application state hash, provided only if AckStatus is AckStatusDiverged                   |
| Signature   | [Signature](#signature)   | Signature of the vote                                                       |

## AckStatus

The AckStatus represents the different statuses of the acknowledgment.

| Value       | Description                                                                 |

| AckAgree    | Validator accepted the proposed block and computed the same AppHash         |
| AckForked   | Validator accepted the proposed block but diverged after processing it      |

## Signature

The Signature structure contains the public key and the signature data of the validator.

| Field       | Type            | Description                                                                 |
