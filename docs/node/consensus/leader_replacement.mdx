Kwil's consensus algorithm relies on a centralized leader responsible for proposing new blocks. However, in certain scenarios, the leader may need to be replaced, such as:
- The leader goes offline, causing the network to stall.
- The leader becomes malicious or fails to operate correctly.

To address this, the network can initiate a leader replacement using one of the following methods:
1. Resolution-Based Leader Replacement (Preferred)
2. replace-leader Command (preferred to use when the leader is offline)

Each method ensures that the network transitions to a new leader without compromising consensus integrity.

## Resolution-Based Leader Replacement (Preferred Method)

This method leverages the param_updates resolution process, where validators vote on a leader change. It is the preferred method but requires the current leader to be online to propose the resolution.

### Process Flow

1. **Leader Update Proposal**:
The new leader candidate submits a resolution proposing the leader update
```sh
kwild consensus propose --updates '{"leader":{"type":"secp256k1","key":"<new-leader-public-key>"}}' --description "Leader update"
```

The command will prompt for confirmation before submitting the resolution.

2. **Verify Submission**:
The resolution should be visible in the list of consensus proposals:

```sh
kwild consensus list-proposals
```

3. **Validator Approval**:
Validators vote on the resolution using the resolutionID from the list-proposals command:

```sh
kwild consensus approve <resolutionID>
```

4. **Resolution Status**:
Check the number of approvals and the current status of the resolution:

```sh
kwild consensus update-status <resolutionID>
```

5. **Leader Transition**:
Upon receiving a majority of approvals, all nodes update their leader to the new candidate. The `CommitInfo` also reflects the leader update.
The new leader will begin proposing blocks, and the network will continue to operate with the new leader.

```go
// ParamUpdates would include leader update
type CommitInfo struct {
	ParamUpdates     ParamUpdates `json:"param_updates,omitempty"`
}
```

## Leader Replacement Using the replace-leader Command

If the leader is offline or the network decides to forcefully replace the leader, the `replace-leader` command can be used.
This method requires both the new leader candidate and a majority of validators to issue the command and provide a future height for the transition to take effect.

```shell
kwild replace-leader <new-leader-public-key> <height>
```

### Process Flow
- The new leader candidate issues the replace-leader command with the new leader’s public key and the future height for the transition.
- A majority of validators also issue the replace-leader command with the same parameters.
- At the specified height h, the new leader begins proposing blocks.
- Validators who participated in the replacement will start accepting the new leader’s blocks and voting for them.
- Once the new leader’s block gains majority approval, it is committed, and a block announcement (blkAnn) message is broadcasted to the network.
- Non-participating nodes (including the old leader) receive the blkAnn message, verify the CommitInfo signatures, and update to the new leader if the majority has signed.

### Handling Leader Disputes at Height h

At height h, both the old leader and new leader candidate may propose blocks. The network can end up in one of three possible states:

1. Majority Agrees to Replace the Leader (x > n/2)
    - The new leader’s block is committed, including validator signatures in CommitInfo.
    - The blkAnn message is sent, informing all nodes of the new leader.
    - The previous leader processes the blkAnn message, demotes itself to a validator, and stops proposing blocks.
    - The network continues operating under the new leader.
2. Majority Rejects the New Leader (x < n/2)
    - Validators process and vote for the old leader’s block, which gets committed at height h.
    - The new leader candidate and validators who supported the change receive the blkAnn message from the old leader and revert to the old leader.
    - The old leader remains in control unless another leader replacement attempt is made in the future.
3. No Clear Majority (x ≈ n/2) → Network Stall
    - If neither leader has majority support (due to some validators being offline or unsynchronized), no block can be committed.
    - The network remains stalled at height h until one of the leaders secures a majority vote.

### Leader Update in Block Headers

As this approach is not-transaction based, for block replayability and leader update verification, the block header includes a `NewLeader` field whenever the leader changes.

```
type BlockHeader struct {
    // New leader for this block if changed through some kind of election.
    NewLeader crypto.PublicKey
}
```
Nodes replaying blocks can choose to accept the blocks from the different leader if the header includes the `NewLeader` field and the `CommitInfo` has the majority of validator signatures indicating that majority of the validators approved to this leader change.
