This guide will teach you how to join an existing Kwil network.  We will first join as a non-validator, and then upgrade to a validator.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, you will need:

- The [`kwil-cli`, `kwild`, and `kwil-admin`](<(https://github.com/kwilteam/binary-releases/releases)>) tools installed.
- The [p2p address](daemon/config/settings.mdx) of a node in the network you want to join
- The [genesis file](daemon/config/genesis.mdx) of the network you want to join
