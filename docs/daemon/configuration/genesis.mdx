A Genesis file defines the initial state and parameters needed to bootstrap a new blockchain network. It serves as the starting point for the entire blockchain system by defining key aspects of the network, including its initial validators, initial height, consensus rules, and more. All participants in the network need to have the same genesis file to start with the same initial conditions. Any discrepancies or errors in the genesis file could prohibit the node either from joining the network or from producing blocks.

## Simple genesis file
Here is an example of genesis.json file with minimal configuration:
```json title="sample genesis.json file"
{
  "genesis_time": "2023-08-28T22:24:04.513472Z",
  "chain_id": "kwil-chain-RQMl2F",
  "initial_height": "0",
  "validators": [
    {
      "address": "6F129A1818CB42DD80FFE51943EAC0BC9FF9E4EE",
      "pub_key": {
        "type": "tendermint/PubKeyEd25519",
        "value": "L737LDRTYv7P5I2apSxOBwJD3U0CS7b2eo9K37s2lPM="
      },
      "power": "1",
      "name": "validator-0"
    }
  ],
  "app_hash": "4F8735846B8CFB01A277430A392DD3DB7B66510C358C5F4A2AF88A348CB20A62"
}
```

## Genesis file contents
A Genesis file essentially consists of:
### Genesis time
 `genesis_time`: This field specifies the official time at which the blockchain is initialized.

### Chain ID
 `chain_id`: This field specifies the ID of the blockchain. This must be unique for every blockchain. The ChainID must be less than 50 symbols.

### Initial height
 `initial_height`: This field sets the initial height the blockchain should begin at. Default value is "0", but in the scenario of network upgrade or restart, starting from the stopped height ensure uniqueness to previous heights. - `initial_height`: This field sets the initial height the blockchain should begin at. Default value is "0", but in the scenario of network upgrade or restart, starting from the stopped height ensure uniqueness to previous heights. 

### Initial Validators
 `validators`: This field sets the List of initial validators. Each validator should provide the below information:


    - `pub_key`: consisting of key types and pubkey bytes.
    - `address`: address of the pub_key
    - `power`: The validatorâ€™s voting power, default: 1 (currently power is treated as a binary config. Power 0 indicates that the node is a non-validator)

    cryptographic keys for a kwild node can be generated using the kwild util cmd line as below. This command will also prints out the pubkey and address which can be used under the validators in the genesis.json file. Refer [cli guide](../cli/utils.mdx#generate-private-key) for more information on using the kwild utils cmdline to generate cryptographic key pairs.
    ```bash
    kwild utils gen-private-key
    ```

### Initial app_hash
 `app_hash`: The app_hash representing the initial application state.

  If the node is booting up with initial data, the app_hash of the genesis file can be initialized/updated by running:
  ```
  kwild utils genesis-hash "path/to/initial/db/dir" --genesis-file "path/to/my/genesis.json"
  ```
  If `--genesis-file` is not provided, the command would stdout the app_hash, which can be used to manually update app_hash in genesis.json. Refer [cli guide](../cli/utils.mdx#create-genesis-hash) for more information on app_hash generation.

## Advanced Configurations
### Consensus Params
Genesis file can also be used to establish predefined set of consensus rules such as:
#### Block rules:
  - `block`: 
      - `max_bytes`: This field specifies the Max block size, in bytes.
      - `max_height`: This field specifies the Max gas per block.

#### Validator type:
  - `validator`:
    -  `pub_key_types`: This field sets the Public key types validators can use.

#### ABCI app Version:
  - `version`:
    - `app_version`: This field sets the ABCI application version. If an ABCI application is running a different version lead to consensus failures. 

#### Block evidence:
  - `evidence`:
      - `max_age_num_blocks`: This field sets the Max age of evidence, in blocks. The basic formula for calculating this is: MaxAgeDuration / {average block time}.
      - `max_age_duration`: This field sets the Max age of evidence, in time.
      - `max_bytes`: This field sets the maximum size in bytes of evidence that can be committed in a single block and should fall comfortably under the max block bytes.
