Validators in CometBFT are responsible for producing new blocks in the blockchain. They do so by participating in a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) based consensus by broadcasting votes containing cryptographic signatures produced by signing the messages using the validator's private key. 

There are 2 ways to become a Validator:
1. Specifying them in the Genesis file before starting the Network
2. Going through a federated consensus-based join process

### Genesis File:
The Kwil network can be deployed with initial set of validators by specifying them in the genesis file. These Genesis validators must be specified under the `"validators"` in the genesis file as shown below. 

```json
 "validators": [
    {
      "address": "186FD58AB225847A54D2176993A534E799F28F68",
      "pub_key": {
        "type": "tendermint/PubKeyEd25519",
        "value": "VoxA4IoO/yySD/KrH5FL4/+In+cGJSinKQqC0NsAmFw="
      },
      "power": "1",
      "name": "validator-0"
    },
    {
      "address": "39303DAA43F5205627E0C6BDDFE36F11BE721F01",
      "pub_key": {
        "type": "tendermint/PubKeyEd25519",
        "value": "A2U6etk0Io2Ixdip9b5TTKNOlI8C7UtRE1J1a/WpEag="
      },
      "power": "1",
      "name": "validator-1"
    }
 ]
```

### Federated consensus-based join process

If a node wants to join as a validator after the deployment, it can do so by undergoing a PBFT consensus-based approval process. The process of joining the network as a validator through federated consensus involves the following steps:

1. Node that wishes to become a Validator must issue a join request transaction. These Join requests are signed by the joiner node's private key. Join requests can be issued using the `kwil-admin` command line tools. For more information, refer to the [join request guide](../../admin/validators.mdx#join)

2. Existing validators on hearing this Join request will vote on whether to allow this node as a Validator. If they decide to allow, they issue an approval request for the joiner signed by the current validator's private key. The approval request is sent as a blockchain transaction. Refer to the [approval request guide](../../admin/validators.mdx#approve) for more information.

3. The join requests are active for the duration of `join_expiry` specified in the genesis file. The join request expires if 2/3rd of the current validators don't approve the join request. The status of the Join request can be queried using the `kwil-admin` command line tools. Refer to the [join request status guide](../../admin/validators.mdx#show-join-request-status) for more information.

4. Once each validator node hears at least a super majority(2/3rd) of approvals by the current validators, they include the joiner node in the ValidatorSet updates sent to the CometBFT core. CometBFT takes consensus on the ValidatorSet updates and if consensus reached, will promote the joiner to the validator status. The joiner node can start participating in the consensus decisions starting from the next round. 

### Step down from Validator status

If a node wants to step down as a Validator, it can do so by sending a leave request transaction signed by its private key. Once the transaction is mined, the CometBFT sets the Validator power to 0, effectively demoting the node from the validator status. From the next round onwards, the node would lose its ability to participate in the consensus decisions.

Leave request can be issued using the `kwil-admin` command line tools. Refer to the [leave request guide](../cli/validator.mdx#leave-request) for more information.
