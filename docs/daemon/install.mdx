description: How to install the Kwil Daemon tool
slug: /daemon/installation
---

While Kwil is under heavy development, the team has made the project closed source. However, the Kwil team regularly releases
Kwil Docker images to Docker Hub. This allows you to run Kwil on your own machine, without having to build the project from source.

To install the most recent Kwil image, run:

```bash
docker pull kwildb/kwil:latest
```
