Use "kwild validator [command] --help" for more information about a command.

#### Join the network as a Validator

Validator join command is used for a non-validator node to issue a request to join the kwil network as a validator. The Join request is signed by the Joiner's private key.  

```
kwild validator join --help
The Join command is used to request to join the network as a validator. Joiner Private key and the Blockchain RPC URL are required.

Validator Power is currently treated as 0/1. If a node has non-zero validator power, that node is considered to be included in the validator list.

Usage:
  kwild validator join [JoinerPrivateKey][power] [flags]

Flags:
      --grpc_listen_addr string   Address to listen for gRPC connections for the application (default "localhost:50051")
  -h, --help                      help for join

Global Flags:
      --config string   kwild config file

```

Join requests for the existing validators are ignored. These requests are nonce protected. 

#### Example:
```
kwild validator join 20825f3eddf9b7f334cfce30dac8d03931965a6a305f7e62185db026d34198ccdfed8973a7c385a320528a7b131418fc57813ae8841dacc0cc6ecf34631f4409 10 --config "/tmp/kwild/config.toml"
```

#### Leave the network as a validator

Validator leave command is used for an existing validator to issue a request to become a non-validator node. Similar to the Node Join request, the leave requests are signed by the private key of the node leaving. 

Leave requests are nonce protected. 

```
validator leave --help
The leave command is used to request to leave the network as a validator. It requires the Private key of the node attempting to leave as a Validator and the Blockchain RPC URL are required.
CometBFT internally sets the validator power to 0 to make the node as a non-validator

Usage:
  kwild validator leave [valPrivateKey] [flags]

Flags:
      --grpc_listen_addr string   Address to listen for gRPC connections for the application (default "localhost:50051")
  -h, --help                      help for leave

Global Flags:
      --config string   kwild config file
```
Leave requests for the nodes that are not currently validators are ignored.

```
kwild validator leave 20825f3eddf9b7f334cfce30dac8d03931965a6a305f7e62185db026d34198ccdfed8973a7c385a320528a7b131418fc57813ae8841dacc0cc6ecf34631f4409 --config "/tmp/kwild/config.toml"
```

#### Approve the Join Request 
Current Validators can express their approval to a node to join as a validator by issuing an Approval request.

```
validator approve --help
The approve command is used by the Validator node to issue a Approve Transaction to approve a joining node as a validator. It requires the public key of the joining node, the private key of the approving node and the blockchain RPC URL. Both keys are base64.

Usage:
  kwild validator approve [JoinerPublicKey] [ApproverPrivateKey] [flags]

Flags:
      --grpc_listen_addr string   Address to listen for gRPC connections for the application (default "localhost:50051")
  -h, --help                      help for approve

Global Flags:
      --config string   kwild config file
```
Only the current validators can send an approval request and approval requests sent by the non-validators are ignored. 

Approval requests are signed by the node approving the request and this signature is used to identify the sender. These requests are nonce protected. 

```
Example:

kwild validator approve RRtYUKGiOVxl8DLpFSQFu4DKvTCcVnOFMsHBPTIv4Gk= 20825f3eddf9b7f334cfce30dac8d03931965a6a305f7e62185db026d34198ccdfed8973a7c385a320528a7b131418fc57813ae8841dacc0cc6ecf34631f4409 --config "path-to-config.toml"

```

#### Join Request status

The join request status of a joiner node can be queried using the status command.
```
kwild validator status --help 
Get the status of a validatorJoin request

Usage:
  kwild validator status [validatorPublicKey] [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for status

Global Flags:
      --config string   kwild config file
```

Example:

```
kwild validator status RRtYUKGiOVxl8DLpFSQFu4DKvTCcVnOFMsHBPTIv4Gk= --config "path-to-config.toml"
```
