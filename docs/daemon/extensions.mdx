description: Running extensions with Kwild

[Extensions](../extensions/introduction.mdx) can be run as separate processes that contain arbitrary business logic.  The Kwil daemon interacts with extensions over a
predefined [gRPC interface](<https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-extensions/blob/main/proto/extension.proto>). Any gRPC server (written in any language) that implements this
interface can be run as a Kwil extension.

While extensions can be run as distributed infrastructure, **it is recommended to run them as containerized sidecars**. Running them as sidecars helps prevent
a lot of transient errors that can occur when running them as distributed infrastructure.  Containerization forces them to run with sandboxed resources, preventing
them from crashing the daemon (which can cause database corruption).

## Quickstart

The quickest way to run an extension is to use the Kwil [extension Docker Compose template](<https://github.com/kwilteam/extension-deployment-template>).
This template utilizes docker-compose to bring up the containers in the correct order.
It also contains the simplest configuration possible for running a local Kwil daemon.

## Configuration

You can use the `KWILD_EXTENSION_ENDPOINTS` environment variable to register gRPC servers as extensions.  To do this, simply set the environment variable
to a comma-separated list of gRPC endpoints:

```bash
export KWILD_EXTENSION_ENDPOINTS="localhost:50051,localhost:50052"
```

### In Docker Compose

The recommended way to use extensions is with Docker Compose.  The same environment variable as shown above is applicable to Docker Compose, except it must be
called from within your Docker Network:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
version: '3'
services:
  extension-1:
    image: <your_image_here>
    ports:
      - 50055:50051
    restart: on-failure

  kwil:
    image: kwildb/kwil:latest
    ports:
      - 50051:50051
      - 8080:8080
    env_file:
      - ./config/kwil.env
    environment:
      - KWILD_EXTENSION_ENDPOINTS=extension-1:50051
    depends_on:
      - extension-1
    restart: on-failure
```

In this example, despite the fact that we map the public port 50055 to the containers internal port 50051, we still use the internal port in the `KWILD_EXTENSION_ENDPOINTS`.
