## Is there an incentivized testnet?

Currently, there is no incentivized Kwil testnet. A handful of node operators run a testnet for builders to test Kwil development experience. The details to connect to the testnet are [here](/docs/links).

## Is there a Kwil token?

There is not currently a Kwil token, and the team does not have plans to release a native Kwil token in the near future. Some Kwil Networks use or will use tokens. Contact the team that deployed the Kwil Network you are using to learn more about the tokenonomics of that network.

## Can I run a Kwil node?

Node operators vary depending on the Kwil Network. Reach out to the deployer of the Kwil Network you are interested in to see if they are allowing new node operators.

If you would like help deploying your own network, ping us in our [Discord](<https://discord.com/invite/HzRPZ59Kay>).
