## Is there an incentivized testnet?

Currently, there is no incentivized Kwil testnet.  We will release information regarding public testnets in the future.

## Is there a Kwil token?

There is not currently a Kwil token, and the team does not have plans to release a token in the near term. All payment for Kwil is done through a Testnet token.

## Why I am getting an "Account Not Found" error?

Usually, an "Account Not Found" error means that the network has not detected that you have deposited any funds.  Ensure that you have claimed **and deposited** testnet tokens from the [faucet](<https://faucet.kwil.com>).

**It can take up to 3 minutes for the Kwil network to recognize funds deposited from Ethereum.**

## Can I run a Kwil node?

Due to the rapidly changing nature of Kwil's software and the operations complexity it brings, we have made the ability to run Kwil nodes available to select design partners.  We will be releasing docs on this soon.  If you would like to become a design partner, ping us in our [Discord](<https://discord.com/invite/HzRPZ59Kay>).
