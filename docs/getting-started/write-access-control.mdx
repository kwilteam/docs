description: Set access control rules for writing to your database.

In this tutorial, we will modify the schema in the first [schema tutorial](/docs/getting-started/create-a-database) to add write access control rules.

Out of the box, Kwil supports a variety of access control capabilities. If you wish to implement more advances access control logic than what is natively available, you can do so by adding an [Extension](/docs/getting-started/using-extensions) to your network.

## Action Privacy

Action privacy can enforce whether an action can be called externally or not. This is useful for actions that should only be called by other actions and not by users.

```sql title="social_media.kf"
// private action to get user id
action get_user_id() private {
  SELECT id
  FROM users 
  WHERE address=@caller;
}

// call the private action within a public action
// it will automatically include the account id
// of the caller in the "author_id" column
action create_post ($id, $title, $content, $date_string) public {
    $author_id = get_user_id();
    INSERT INTO posts (id, title, content, author_id, post_date)
    VALUES ($id, $title, $content, $author_id, $date_string);
}
```

## Raising Errors

In an action, you can use SQL `CASE` statements to raise errors if certain conditions are not met. If an error is raised, the transaction will fail entirely, and data will not be written to the network.

```sql title="social_media.kf"
// create a new balances table to track user balances
table balances {
    id int primary notnull,
    author_id int notnull,
    balance int notnull
}

// private action to check balance
action check_balance($author_id, $amount) private {
    SELECT
        CASE
            WHEN balance < $amount THEN ERROR('Insufficient funds')
            ELSE null
        END
    FROM balances
    WHERE author_id = $author_id;
}

// call the private action within a public view action, and require that the balance is at least 10
action get_posts($user_id) public view {
    check_balance($user_id, 10);
    SELECT * FROM posts WHERE author_id = $user_id;
}
```

## Owner-only Actions

Actions can be given an `owner` privacy level, which means that only the owner of the database can call the action. This is useful for actions that should only be called by the database owner, such as admin operations.

```sql title="social_media.kf"
// owner only action to delete a user
action delete_user($user_id) owner {
    DELETE FROM users WHERE id = $user_id;
}
```
