In this tutorial, you will create, write to, and read from your first table within Kwil. This guide uses the [Kwil CLI](/docs/category/cli).

## Prerequisites

- [Kwil CLI](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/releases) - Download from the Kwil Binary Releases.
- Ethereum Private Key - You will need an Ethereum private key to sign transactions to Kwil.
If you do not have one, you can generate one using the [`kwil-cli utils generate-key`](/docs/ref/kwil-cli/utils/generate-key#examples) command.
- Kwil RPC - You will need the RPC endpoint of the Kwil network you are deploying to. This can be obtained by either running a [node
locally](/docs/node/quickstart), or by obtaining an endpoint from [Kwil Firebird](https://admin.kwil.com/firebird/).

## Creating a Table

Define a table in a file called `social_media.sql`:

```sql title="social_media.sql"
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    age INT NOT NULL,
    address TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE // user wallet addresses
);
```

To deploy the table, use the `kwil-cli exec-sql` command. This command executes either a single statement or a file containing
multiple statements. The example below include the `--sync` flag, which instructs the CLI to wait for the transaction to be
mined and display the result of the transaction. Without the `--sync` flag, the command will return immediately after sending
the transaction and display only the transaction hash, without any information as to whether the transaction succeeded or failed.

```shell
$ kwil-cli --private-key <YOUR_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY> --provider <YOUR_PROVIDER_URL> \
    exec-sql --file social_media.sql --sync
```

:::tip
The above example passes a private key and provider endpoint as flags. To avoid having to do this for every interaction,
you can configure default values for these flags using `kwil-cli configure`.

To learn more about configuring the Kwil CLI, see the [Configuration](/docs/kwil-cli/configuration) guide.

## Inserting Data

To insert data into the table, use the same `kwil-cli exec-sql` command. The example below passes a statement from the command
line, rather than a file. The example also uses the @caller variable, which will insert your own private key's wallet address
into the table.

```shell
$ kwil-cli --private-key <YOUR_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY> --provider <YOUR_PROVIDER_URL> \
    exec-sql --stmt "INSERT INTO users (id, username, age, address) VALUES ('90cc39f3-4ad5-425d-b127-3b0f62b5abd3'::uuid, 'Alice', 25, @caller);" \
    --sync
```

## Querying Data

To query data from the table, use the `kwil-cli query` command. This command executes a read-only SQL statement and returns the
result. It does not require a private key, unless you are interacting with an RPC that requires authentication.

```shell
$ kwil-cli --provider <YOUR_PROVIDER_URL> query --stmt 'SELECT * FROM users;'
|                  address                   | age | id | username |
+--------------------------------------------+-----+----+----------+
| 0xAfFDC06cF34aFD7D5801A13d48C92AD39609901D |  25 |  1 | Alice    |
```
