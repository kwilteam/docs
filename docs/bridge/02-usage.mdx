This page will guide you through how to use the ERC20 bridge once it has been set up. For information on setting
up the bridge, see the [Setup](/docs/erc20-bridge/setup) page.

## Initializing the Bridge Extension

Balances for bridged tokens are managed using a built-in extension in the Kwil database. All distributions
of `kwild` have this extension included by default. To initialize the extension, use the [`USE` statement](/docs/language/extensions).
The `erc20_bridge` initialization has the following fields:

- `chain`[required]: The chain name of the EVM chain the bridge is connected to. Currently Kwil supports `sepolia` and `ethereum`, but if you need another chain, please let us know as it is easy to add.
- `escrow`[required]: The address of the escrow smart contract.
- `distribution_period`[optional]: The amount of time that should elapse between distribution epochs. The default is `10m`.
Valid time units are "s", "m", "h". The minimum value is `10m` and the maximum value is `168h` (1 week).

```sql
USE erc20_bridge {
    chain: 'sepolia',
    escrow: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
    distribution_period: '1h'
} AS my_bridged_token;
```

This statement initializes the bridge extension and assigns it the namespace `my_bridged_token`. This namespace
can be used to interact with the bridge extension.

## Depositing Tokens

To deposit tokens to the bridge, you simply have to transfer tokens to the escrow smart contract. The network will
listen to the erc20 `Transfer` event and mint the equivalent amount of tokens on the Kwil database to the wallet.

All token deposits will take a few blocks to be processed, to ensure no re-orgs occur before the bridge is complete.
This time period is chain-specific, with Ethereum mainnet taking 12 blocks to confirm.

To check the balance of bridged tokens, you can call the `balance` action on the `my_bridged_token` namespace:

```sql
CREATE ACTION my_action() public {
    $balance := my_bridged_token.balance('0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890');
}
```

## Transferring Tokens

There are two ways to transfer tokens on a Kwil database:
- Using the `transfer` action, which transfers the tokens between two wallet addresses.
- Using the `lock` or `admin_lock` actions, which debit the tokens from the specified wallet and credit them to the database
itself. This effectively allows a Kwil database to hold tokens itself, which it can later distribute to other wallets.

### Transfer

To transfer tokens between two wallet addresses, use the `transfer` action.
**Note that all token balances are stored as `NUMERIC(78,0)`, which is a native Postgres data type
capable of storing up to 78 digits of precision, which is enough to store the maximum possible uint256 value**.

```sql
CREATE ACTION my_transfer($to_address TEXT, $amount NUMERIC(78,0)) public {
    my_bridged_token.transfer($to_address, $amount);
}
```

### Lock

To lock tokens, use either the `lock` or `admin_lock` action. The `lock` action locks tokens from the caller's wallet address.
The `admin_lock` action locks tokens from a specified wallet address.

```sql
CREATE ACTION my_lock($amount NUMERIC(78,0)) public {
    my_bridged_token.lock($amount);
    my_bridged_token.lock_admin('0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890', $amount);
}
```

## Giving Tokens to Users

There are three ways to give tokens to users:

- Using the `bridge` action, which allows transfers tokens from a user's balance in the database back to the layer 1 network.
- Using the `issue` action, which transfers locked tokens from the database to the layer 1 network, where a user can claim them.
- Using the `unlock` action, which transfers locked tokens from the database to a user's balance in the database.

### Bridge

To allow a user to bridge their tokens back to the layer 1 network, use the `bridge` action.

```sql
CREATE ACTION my_bridge($amount NUMERIC(78,0)) public {
    my_bridged_token.bridge($amount);
}
```

### Issue

To issue tokens held by the database to the user on the layer 1 network, use the `issue` action.

```sql
CREATE ACTION my_issue($to_address TEXT, $amount NUMERIC(78,0)) public {
    my_bridged_token.issue($to_address, $amount);
}
```

### Unlock

To unlock tokens from the database to a user's balance, use the `unlock` action.

```sql
CREATE ACTION my_unlock($to_address TEXT, $amount NUMERIC(78,0)) public {
    my_bridged_token.unlock($to_address, $amount);
}
```

## Claiming Tokens

To claim tokens from the escrow smart contract, users will need to perform two steps:
1. Get the inclusion proof for the token distribution from the database.
2. Call the escrow smart contract with the inclusion proof to claim the tokens.

### Get Inclusion Proof

To get all inclusion proofs for a user that can be claimed on chain, use the `list_wallet_rewards` action.

```shell
kwil-cli call-action list_wallet_rewards --namespace my_bridged_token text:YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

### Claim Tokens

To claim tokens from the escrow smart contract, call the `claimReward` function on the escrow smart contract with the inclusion proof.
The smart contract function has the following signature:

```solidity
function claimReward(
    address recipient,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes32 kwilBlockHash,
    bytes32 rewardRoot,
    bytes32[] calldata proofs
)
```

Alternatively, Kwil will also provide a simple UI that automates this process for users. This is still in development.
