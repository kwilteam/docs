Now that we have covered some of the more advanced features offered by Kuneiform, we can begin exploring some of the advanced SQL syntax Kwil supports.

You can view the full syntax tree supported by Kwil in the [SQL section](/docs/category/sql-as-understood-by-kwil).

## Prerequisites

This section assumes prior familiarity with SQL.

## Syntax Features

### Subqueries

Kwil supports nesting subqueries within a query to retrieve a value from another table. In the example below, we use a subquery to retrieve a user's identifier based on their wallet address.

```typescript title="social_network.kf"
action like_post($post_id) public {
    INSERT INTO likes (user_id, post_id)
    VALUES ((
        SELECT id
        FROM users
        WHERE address = address(@caller)
    ),
    $post_id);
}
```

### Joins

Another feature supported in Kwil are joins, allowing developers to join tables for executing unique or complex queries.

In the `get_feed` action below, we use two `INNER JOIN`s to return a result of posts that match when the id of a user matches the id of an account they follow. The action only returns the 20 most recent posts, so it also contains an optional `OFFSET` to allow users to retrieve posts 1-20, 21-40, etc.

```typescript title="social_network.kf"
// get_feed gets the 20 most recent posts from accounts a user follows, and takes an offset to specify where the counting should begin
action get_feed($username, $offset) public view {
    SELECT p.id, p.title, p.content, p.post_date, u.username
    FROM posts AS p
    INNER JOIN followers AS f ON p.author_id = f.followed_id
    INNER JOIN users AS u ON u.id = f.followed_id
    WHERE f.follower_id = (
        SELECT id
        FROM users
        WHERE username = $username
    )
    ORDER BY date(p.post_date) DESC NULLS LAST
    LIMIT 20 OFFSET $offset
}
```

Note that join statements are not allowed in `DELETE` queries. As an alternative to using a JOIN, you can use a subquery to retrieve the desired data.

For example, in the `delete_post` action, we can all a subquery to retrieve the auther id from the users table.

```typescript title="social_network.kf"

action delete_post ($id) public {
    DELETE FROM posts
    WHERE id=$id
    AND author_id = (
        SELECT id
        FROM users
        WHERE address=address(@caller)
    );
}
```

### Common Table Expressions

Kwil also allows you to define Common Table Expressions (CTE) that can be referenced in your queries.

In the `get_celebrity_feed` action, we create a Common Table Expression to reference all of the accounts with over 50,000 followers. With this CTE, we execute a similar query to the one in the `get_feed` action. This common table expression allows us to retrieve the posts for the accounts that a user follows with over 50,000 followers.

:::note

This action is made purely to display CTE's in an understandable way. It is not necessarily the most efficient way to perform the desired query.

:::

```typescript title="social_network.kf"
action get_celebrity_feed($username, $offset) public view {
// using a CTE containing popular users
    WITH popular_users AS (
        SELECT followers.followed_id AS id, users.username AS username
        FROM followers
        INNER JOIN users ON users.id = followers.followed_id
        GROUP BY followers.followed_id
        HAVING count(followers.follower_id) >= 50000
    )
    SELECT p.id, p.title, p.content, p.post_date, pu.username
    FROM posts AS p
    INNER JOIN popular_users AS pu ON pu.id = p.author_id
    WHERE p.author_id IN (
        SELECT followed_id
        FROM followers
        WHERE follower_id = (
            SELECT id
            FROM users
            WHERE username = $username
        )
    )
    ORDER BY date(p.post_date) DESC NULLS LAST
    LIMIT 20 OFFSET $offset;
}
```

You can go through the other actions in the `social_network.kf` file to see the variety of ways we can apply subqueries, joins, and CTEs to create unique CRUD functionality for our social media application.
