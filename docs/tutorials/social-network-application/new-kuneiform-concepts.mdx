In this tutorial, we will expand on the functionality introduced in the [Hello World Tutorial](/docs/tutorials/hello-world/creating-the-database) to showcase some of the advanced functionality provided in Kuneiform and Kwil's supported SQL syntax.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the concepts introduced in the [Hello World Tutorial](/docs/tutorials/hello-world/creating-the-database), including:
- How to fund your database
- Basic Kuneiform Syntax for database decelarations, tables, and actions.
- How to interact with your database via the Kwil JS/TS SDK.
- How to execution actions and read-only queries on your database.

If any of these concepts are not familiar to you, we strongly recommend returning to the [Hello World Tutorial](/docs/tutorials/hello-world/creating-the-database) and then come back to this tutorial.

## Setup
This tutorial references the `social_network.kf` file that comes loaded in the [Kuneiform IDE](https://ide.kwil.com/). You can find this file under the `sample_databases` folder.

If the file is not in your IDE, simply clear all browsing history for https://ide.kwil.com and reload the page.

:::warning

Clearing your browser history will remove any created or saved files in the IDE.

## Schema Overview
The schema contains five tables: `users`, `posts`, `likes`, and `followers`.

The schema contains 13 actions that could be called within a social media application to execute some database CRUD operations: `create_user`, `update_users`, `create_posts`, `delete_post`, `like_post`, `unlike_post`, `follow`, `unfollow`, `get_user_by_username`, `get_users_by_wallet`, `get_feed`, and `celebrity_get_feed`.

## Concepts

### Public & Private Actions

Public / private actions function similarily to how public / private methods work in TypeScript. In Kwil, public actions mean that they can be called externally by a database user. Private actions can only be called from within other Kuneiform actions.

```typescript tite="social_network.kf"
action check_balance() private {
    SELECT
        CASE
            WHEN balance < 10 THEN ERROR('insufficient balance')
            ELSE null
        END
    FROM balances WHERE wallet = @caller;
}

action read_post($post_id) public {
    check_balance();
    SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $post_id;
}
```

In the example file, we we have a private action that checks whether the user's wallet has a balance of at least 10. If the balance is less than 10, the action will throw an error. This action can then be called within any other action in the file to enforce a minimum balance requirement before executing an action.

### Contextual Variables

Kuneiform syntax contains the concept of contextual variables. Contextual variables contain values that are based on the current execution of an action.  They are denoted by an `@` prefix, followed by the variable name. An example is `@caller`, which injects the wallet address of the action caller.  See the [contextual variables section](../../kuneiform/dml#using-contextual-variables-in-actions) for more information.

```typescript title="social_network.kf"
action create_user ($id, $username, $age) public {
    INSERT INTO users
    VALUES ($id, $username, $age, @caller);
}
```

In the example above, we use the caller variable to automatically retrieve a users wallet address and pass it as a value to the SQL query. When the action is executed, it will only require the `$id`, `username`, and `age` parameters. The wallet address will be automatically passed when the transaction is signed.

### Date-Time Functions
Kwil allows certain deterministic date-time functions in its SQL syntax. This is useful for executing comparison operations with date information.

Operations in a decentralized system must be deterministic; this means that we can not use local machine time for timestamping. Thus, users must provide their own date-time string when executing an action.

```typescript title="social_network.kf"
// date value is YYYY-MM-DD
action create_post ($id, $title, $content, $date_string) public {
    INSERT INTO posts (id, title, content, author_id, post_date)
    VALUES ($id, $title, $content, (
        SELECT id
        FROM users
        WHERE address=@caller
    ), $date_string);
}
```

Once the date-time string is set, we can call date-time functions in our queries.

```typescript title="social_network.kf"
action get_feed($username, $offset) public {
    SELECT p.id, p.title, p.content, p.post_date, u.username
    FROM posts AS p
    INNER JOIN followers AS f ON p.author_id = f.followed_id
    INNER JOIN users AS u ON u.id = f.followed_id
    WHERE f.follower_id = (
        SELECT id
        FROM users
        WHERE username = $username
    )
    ORDER BY date(p.post_date) DESC NULLS LAST
    LIMIT 20 OFFSET $offset
}
```

In the query above, we are able to use the `date()` function to order the posts in a user's feed by their timestamp.

That is all for step 1 of the social network tutorial! In step 2, we will walk through some of the more advanced SQL syntax Kwil supports and showcase how it enables unique functionality in our application.
