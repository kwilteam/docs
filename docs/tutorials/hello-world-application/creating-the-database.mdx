In Step 1 of this tutorial, we will walk through creating the database for a "Hello World" Kwil application.
This will introduce you to the basic concepts of Kwil, including creating a database using the Kuneiform IDE, and exposing actions to allow access the database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the prerequisites outlined in the ["Prerequisites"](../../prerequisites.md) section.

This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of SQL.

## Setup

The quickest way to deploy your database is in the [Kuneiform IDE](https://ide.kwil.com). (You can also use the [Kwil CLI](/docs/kwil-cli/installation), but this will be introduced in a later Tutorial.)

In the [Kuneiform IDE](https://ide.kwil.com/), you must connect your wallet to the endpoint for the Kwil Network you are deploying to. 

For this tutorial, we will be deploying to a network running on `http://localhost:8080`. 

Add a new network by clicking on the `Default Workspace` dropdown in the Kuneiform IDE. This will bring up the `Workspace` Menu. Click on the `New Workspace +` option.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img src={require("./assets/workspace-menu.png").default} alt="Workspace Menu" />
</div>
<br />

Next, add the network details in the popup Menu. After you click "OK", the IDE will automatically switch to the new network.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"  }}>
  <img src={require("./assets/add-workspace.png").default} alt="Token Deposit" />
</div>

## Declaring Database Schema and Actions

In the Kuneiform IDE, click on the 'New File' icon and create a new file called `hello-world.kf`. This file will contain the database declaration, tables, and actions that can be executed on the database.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"  }}>
  <img src={require("./assets/add-new-file.png").default} alt="Add new Kuneiform file" />
</div>

#### 1. Database Declaration
In the `hello-world.kf` file, declare the database name. Note that the database declaration must the first line of the file and must be in the format `database <database-name>;`.

```sql title="hello-world.kf"
database hello_world;
```

#### 2. Table Declaration
Next, we will declare the tables that exist in the database. 

Tables are declared in the format 

```sql
table <table-name> { 
     <column-name> <column-type> <column-attributes>, 
     ...
}
```

For information on support data types, attributes, and other features, visit the [supported features](../../kuneiform/supported-features) section.

#### 3. Adding B-Tree indexes

Indexing freqently-accessed columns improves performance. Indexes can be added to one or more columns by adding the following to the `table` declaration.:
```
  #<index-name> <index-type>(<index-columns>)
``` 

Below, we create a B-Tree index called `wallet_index` on the `wallet` column:

```sql title="hello-world.kf"
database hello_world;

table greetings {
  id int primary notnull,
  message text notnull maxlen(100),
  wallet text notnull,
  #wallet_index index(wallet)
}
```

#### 4. Declaring Actions
Lastly, we will declare the actions that can be used to access the database. 
Actions are predefined SQL statements that can be executed on the database. 

Actions are declared in the format:
```sql
action <action-name> ($<action-parameter>) <private/public> { 
  <sql-statement>;
}
``` 
More information on on the supported Kwil SQL syntax can be found [here](/docs/category/sql-as-understood-by-kwil). More information on the supported environment variables can be found [here](../../kuneiform/dml#using-contextual-variables-in-actions).

Below are four actions for executing select, insert, update, and delete queries on the database.

```sql title="hello-world.kf"
database hello_world;

table greetings {
  id int primary notnull,
  message text notnull maxlen(100),
  wallet text notnull,
  #wallet_index index(wallet)
}

action select_greetings () public view {
  SELECT * FROM greetings;
}

action insert_greeting ($id, $message) public {
  INSERT INTO greetings
  VALUES ($id, $message, address(@caller));
}

action update_greeting ($id, $message) public {
  UPDATE greetings 
  SET message = $message 
  WHERE id = $id AND wallet = address(@caller);
}

action delete_greeting ($id) public {
  DELETE FROM greetings 
  WHERE id = $id AND wallet = address(@caller);
}
```

## Compiling Kuneiform source files

Now that we have completed our Kuneiform database and action definitions, click on the `Compile and Deploy` icon in left-hand navigation panel in the IDE, 
and select our `hello-world.kf` file from the dropdown:

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"  }}>
  <img src={require("./assets/compile-kuneiform.png").default} alt="Compile and Deploy" />
</div>
<br />

Then, click `Compile`. Your Kuneiform code will now be checked for errors, and compiled into JSON to be submitted to the Kwil network.
You will be notified if the code has compiled successfully. If there are any syntax errors, you will be advised of the error and line number at which it occurred.

## Deploying a Database

After successful compilation, click the `Deploy` button to deploy the database to the Kwil network. 
You will receive a confirmation message once the database is deployed.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", width: "75%", margin: "auto" }}>
  <img src={require("./assets/deploy-successful.png").default} alt="Token Approval" />
</div>
<br />

Congratulations! Now that you have successfully created a database on the Kwil network, let's move on to Step 2, where we will test our database using the Kwil SDK.
