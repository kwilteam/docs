In this tutorial, we will walk through creating a very simple "Hello World" application with Kwil. This tutorial will introduce you to the basics of Kwil, including creating a database and executing actions through the SDK.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the prerequisites outlined in the ["Prerequisites"](../../prerequisites.md) section. The Kwil testnet tokens received from the [faucet](https://faucet.kwil.com) will be used to fund the database.

This tutorial also assumes a basic understanding of SQL.

## Setup

The quickest way to deploy your database is in the [Kuneiform IDE](https://ide.kwil.com). You can also use the [Kwil CLI](/docs/cli/installation.md).

In the Kuneiform IDE, you must connect to the endpoint for the Kwil Network you are deploying to. For this tutorial, we will be deploying to a network running on `http://localhost:8080`. You can add your network in the `Workspace` Menu:

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img src={require("./assets/workspace-menu.png").default} alt="Workspace Menu" />
</div>
<br />

Next, add the network details in the popup Menu. After you click "OK", the IDE will automatically switch to the new network.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"  }}>
  <img src={require("./assets/add-workspace.png").default} alt="Token Deposit" />
</div>

## Create Database

In the Kuneiform IDE, create a new file called `hello-world.kf`. This file will contain the database declaration, tables, and actions that can be executed on the database.

#### 1. Declare Database
In the `hello-world.kf` file, declare the database name. Note that the database declaration must the first line of the file and must be in the format `database <database-name>;`.

```typescript title="hello-world.kf"
database hello_world;
```

#### 2. Declare Tables
Next, declare the tables that will exist in the database. Tables are declared in the format `table <table-name> { <column-name> <column-type> <column-attributes>,};`. For information on support data types, attributes, and other features, visit the [supported features](../../kuneiform/supported-features) section.

You can also add an index to one or more columns by calling `#<index-name> <index-type>(<index-columns>)` in the table declaration. Below, we create a B-Tree index on the `wallet` column.

```typescript title="hello-world.kf"
database hello_world;

table greetings {
  id int primary notnull,
  message text notnull maxlen(100),
  wallet text notnull,
  #wallet_index index(wallet)
}
```

#### 3. Declare Actions
Lastly, declare the actions that will be used in the database. Actions are predefined SQL statements that can be executed on the database. Actions are declared in the format `action <action-name> ($<action-paramater>) <private/public> { <sql-statement> };`. More information on on the supported Kwil SQL syntax can be found [here](/docs/category/sql-as-understood-by-kwil). More information on the supported environment variables can be found [here](../../kuneiform/dml#using-contextual-variables-in-actions).

Below are four actions for executing select, insert, update, and delete queries on the database.

```typescript title="hello-world.kf"
database hello_world;

table greetings {
  id int primary notnull,
  message text notnull maxlen(100),
  wallet text notnull,
  #wallet_index index(wallet)
}

action select_greetings () public view {
  SELECT * FROM greetings;
}

action insert_greeting ($id, $message) public {
  INSERT INTO greetings
  VALUES ($id, $message, address(@caller));
}

action update_greeting ($id, $message) public {
  UPDATE greetings 
  SET message = $message 
  WHERE id = $id AND wallet = address(@caller);
}

action delete_greeting ($id) public {
  DELETE FROM greetings 
  WHERE id = $id AND wallet = address(@caller);
}
```

## Deploy Database
Once the Kuneiform file is complete, toggle to the third tab in the IDE and select the `hello-world.kf` file from the dropdown. Then, click the `Compile` and `Deploy` buttons to deploy the database to the Kwil network. You will receive a confirmation message once the database is deployed.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", width: "75%", margin: "auto" }}>
  <img src={require("./assets/deploy-successful.png").default} alt="Token Approval" />
</div>
<br />

And that is it! You have successfully created a database on the Kwil network. In step 2, we will walk through using the database with the Kwil SDK.
