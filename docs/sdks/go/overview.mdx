## Overview

The Kwil Go Client is a library that allows you to interact with Kwil networks using the Go programming language. The library provides a simple interface for:
- Querying network information (e.g. accounts, schemas, transaction status, etc.).
- Deploying and dropping schemas.
- Executing actions (mutative and read-only).
- Executing ad-hoc SQL queries.

## Documentation

The Go Client documentation and tutorial are available in the [`kwil-db` GitHub repository](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db). The repository also contains an example to help you get started with the Go Client.
