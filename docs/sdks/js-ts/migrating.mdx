# Kwil-JS Migration Guide

This document contains important information for migrating between Kwil-JS versions.

For migrations guides between earlier versions, please look for this document in the corresponding [release tag](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-js/tags).

If you have any questions on a migration, please reach out to luke@kwil.com.

## Migrating from @kwilteam/kwil-js@0.8 to @kwilteam/kwil-js@0.9

Below is a list of all key changes from the [@kwilteam/kwil-js v0.8 SDK](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-js/releases/tag/v0.8.6) to the v0.9

Note that kwil-js v0.9 must be used with kwil-db v0.10.0.

### New Features

#### Execute ad-hoc CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/ALTER SQL queries with `kwil.execSql()`

New to kwil-db v0.10, database owners and wallets with relevant permissions can execute ad-hoc SQL queries. In kwil-js, this is done with the `kwil.execSql()` method.

Example:

```javascript
await kwil.execSql(
    'INSERT INTO table (column1, column2) VALUES ($value1, $value2)', 
    { $value1: 'value1', $value2: 'value2' },
    kwilSigner, // signer 
    true // wait for transaction to be included in a block
);
```

#### Positional Arguments to `kwil.call()` and `kwil.execute()`

You can now pass positional arguments to `kwil.call()` and `kwil.execute()` as a tuple. This can be used as an alternative to named parameters.

Example:

```javascript
await kwil.call({
    namespace: 'some_namespace',
    action: 'action_name',
    inputs: [ 'first_param_val',  'second_param_val' ]
});

await kwil.execute({
    namespace: 'some_namespace',
    name: 'action_name',
    inputs: [
        // multiple sets of inputs will bulk execute the action
        [ 'first_param_val',  'second_param_val' ],
        [ 'first_param_val',  'second_param_val' ]
    ]
}, kwilSigner);
```

### Breaking Changes

#### The `inputs` field on Kwil.call() only takes a single input

Previously, the `inputs` field on the `ActionBody` interface took an array of inputs. Now, the `inputs` field only takes a single input, and it is no longer an array.

##### Old Version

```javascript
await kwil.call({
    dbid: 'some_dbid',
    action: 'action_name',
    inputs: [ {$param1: 'some_param'} ]
});
```

##### New Version

```javascript
await kwil.call({
    namespace: 'some_namespace',
    action: 'action_name',
    inputs: {$param1: 'some_param'}
});
```

#### The `dbid` field on `kwil.call()` and `kwil.execute()` has been renamed to `namespace`

Consistent with the change in kwil-db v0.10 to use `namespace` instead of `dbid`, the `dbid` field on the `ActionBody` interface has been renamed to `namespace`.

##### Old Version

```javascript
await kwil.execute({
    dbid: 'some_dbid',
    name: 'action_name',
    inputs: [ 'inputs' ]
}, kwilSigner);
```

##### New Version

```javascript
await kwil.execute({
    namespace: 'some_namespace',
    name: 'action_name',
    inputs: [ 'inputs' ]
}, kwilSigner);
```

#### The `kwil.selectQuery()` method signature has changed.

The `kwil.selectQuery()` method signature has changed to take a a query string and parameters as arguments. Previously, it took a dbid and query string as arguments.

##### Old Version

```javascript
await kwil.selectQuery('some_dbid', 'SELECT * FROM table');
```

##### New Version

```javascript
await kwil.selectQuery('SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = $id', { $id: 1 });
```

### Deprecations

#### The `kwil.getDBID()` method is deprecated

The `kwil.getDBID()` method has been deprecated, as Kwil v0.10 uses namespaces instead of dbids.

#### The `kwil.getSchema()` method is deprecated

The `kwil.getSchema()` method has been deprecated. To retrieve schema information, query the `info` namespace with `kwil.selectQuery()`. Learn more about the `info` namespace [here](https://prerelease.kwil.com/docs/language/info-namespace/). For example:

```javascript
await kwil.selectQuery('SELECT * FROM info.actions');
```

#### The `kwil.deploy()` method is deprecated

The `kwil.deploy()` method is deprecated. Use `kwil.execSql()` to create namespaces, tables, actions, etc.

#### The `kwil.drop()` method is deprecated

The `kwil.drop()` method is deprecated. Use `kwil.execSql()` to drop namespaces, tables, actions, etc.

#### The `kwil.listDatabases()` method is deprecated

The `kwil.listDatabases()` method is deprecated. Use `kwil.selectQuery()` to query the `info` namespace for database information.

#### The `ActionInput` class is deprecated

The `ActionInput` class is deprecated. Pass inputs to actions as an object instead.
