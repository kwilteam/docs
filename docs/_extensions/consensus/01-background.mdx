In general, when a new version of some node software is released that contains
changes affecting consensus rules or parameters, upgrading may involve
transient network interruption as a super-majority of validators update, or even
require full network migration if backward compatibility is lost. If the new
software is unable to execute historical transactions in blocks produced by
previous versions, the resolution is deploying a new chain with previous state
at genesis (network migration). It is desirable to avoid these outcomes.

Network interruption may be minimized with a network-wide *coordinated upgrade*.
For instance, CometBFT (the consensus engine)[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2] and Cosmos
SDK[^3]<sup>,</sup>[^4] have required coordinated upgrades between major
releases. In some cases, operators plan to upgrade their software around the
same time to minimize interruption in block production while the required 2/3+
of validators update. In other cases, it involves a network halt followed by
exporting state for a new genesis.

`kwild` provides mechanisms for performing coordinated upgrades with minimal
network disruption and without resetting a chain from genesis. The next section
describes how network operators and developers may specify these upgrades.
