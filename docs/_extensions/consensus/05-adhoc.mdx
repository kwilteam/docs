Other changes that cannot be realized with those exposed by the extension system
may still be coordinated, without a network migration, with changes to the
`kwild` source to introduce ad-hoc conditional logic based on chain height. This
approach is more typical for long lived public blockchains.

:::caution

Prefer implementing changes with extensions as described in [Extension-based Changes](#extension-based-changes).

This section pertains to changes that are likely to affect all Kwil networks,
and are intended to be canonical updates shipped with official releases from the
Kwil team.

:::

The `Forks` method of the genesis configuration modeled by `common/chain.GenesisConfig`
returns an instance of a `common/chain/forks.Forks` type that provides `kwild` with
the ability to add conditional logic based on block height at arbitrary parts of the
source code. Unlike [extension-based](/docs/extensions/fork-ext) changes, `kwild`
source is modified to define canonical changes described in this section. The process
of defining a canonical fork is:

1. Add a new `*uint64` field to the `Forks struct`, such as `ChangesetX *uint64`.
2. Define a corresponding "`Is`" method, such as `IsChangesetX(height uint64) bool`,
   to indicate if the changes should be in effect _as of_ the given height.
3. Define a corresponding "`Begins`" method, such as `BeginsChangesetX(height uint64) bool`,
   to indicate if the changes should go into effect _at_ the given height.

Anywhere in the source that has access to (1) this `Forks` struct and (2) the
current block height may then define conditional logic to alter execution or
other consensus-level behavior such as block proposal or approval. For instance:

```go
if f.IsChangesetX(height) {
    // new rules (thresholds, formulae, conditions, etc.) in this code
} else {
    // legacy behavior
}
```

This facilitates changes to functions that affect consensus such as transaction
execution outcome, account state changes, "app hash" computation, etc. without
consensus failure or validator disagreement that can affect network liveness.

Again, [extension-based changes](/docs/extensions/fork-ext) are preferred as no
modifications to `kwild` source are required. The canonical fork approach is
intended for highly integrated changes implemented by the Kwil team.
