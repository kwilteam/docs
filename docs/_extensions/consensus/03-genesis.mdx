The genesis configuration file, `genesis.json`, contains a section where heights
for these named "forks" should have their rule changes become active. This tells
`kwild` when old or new rules should apply, permitting seamless changes to
consensus-level logic.

In the main `kwil-db` Go module, the `common/chain.GenesisConfig` structure
models the `genesis.json` file. An `"activations"` field is used to associate
named rule change sets with an activation height. For instance:

```json
{
  "genesis_time": "2024-04-15T17:00:34.108598516Z",
  "chain_id": "kwil-chain-g1KPHOsY",
  "initial_height": 1,
  "app_hash": null,
  "activations": {
    "kancun": 1234000
  },
  ...
}
```

With the above in the genesis configuration, a backward incompatible rule change
named `"kancun"` is scheduled to activate at height 1234000. If the height value
is `null` or a fork name is omitted, those changes are disabled. If the height
is `0`, they are in effect at genesis. Ethereum node operators are also likely
to be familiar with this system.
