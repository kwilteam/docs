In order to use extensions with Kwil, users need to build custom binaries that include the extensions they want to use.
This guide will walk you through the process of building a custom Kwil binary with extensions.

## Prerequisites

Before building a custom binary, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Go 1.21+](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

# Step 1: Setting up the environment

Start by setting up the repo for building the custom binary. This will be a standard Go repo setup.

Create a new directory for the binary and navigate to it:

```shell
mkdir custom-kwil
cd custom-kwil
```

Initialize a new Go module:

```shell
go mod init custom-kwil
```

Install the Kwil SDK:
    
```shell
go get github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db
```

Run `go mod tidy` to ensure all dependencies are installed.

```shell
go mod tidy
```

## Step 2: Set up main.go

Create a new file called `main.go` in the root of the project directory:

```shell
touch main.go
```

Add the following code to `main.go`:

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"

	"github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/cmd/custom"
)

func main() {
	err := custom.NewCustomCmd(custom.CommonCmdConfig{
		RootCmd:     "my-custom-cmd",
		ProjectName: "My Project Name",
	}).Execute()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	os.Exit(0)
}
```

## Step 3: Add a custom extension

In the same directory as `main.go`, create a new file called `custom_extension.go`:

```shell
touch custom_extension.go
```

Add the following code to `custom_extension.go`. This example uses a custom authenticator extension, however any
type of extension can be added in this step using their respective `Register` function in the `init` function of the extension file.

:::tip
Examples on how to implement each type of extensions can be found in their respective sections.

:::warning
This example is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in a production environment.
For a production-ready Ed25519 authenticator, please refer to the [Ed25519 authenticator guide](/docs/extensions/example-ed25519).
:::

```go title="custom_extension.go"
package main

import (
    "crypto/ed25519"
    "fmt"
    "encoding/hex"

    "github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/extensions/auth"
)

// init registers the Ed25519Authenticator with the Kwil node
func init() {
    err := auth.RegisterAuthenticator("ed25519_example", Ed25519Authenticator{})
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}

type Ed25519Authenticator struct{}

// Verify verifies the signature of a message
func (Ed25519Authenticator) Verify(sender, msg, signature []byte) error {
    if !ed25519.Verify(sender, msg, signature) {
        return fmt.Errorf("signature verification failed")
    }

    return nil
}

// Identifier returns the hex encoding of the public key
func (Ed25519Authenticator) Identifier(sender []byte) (string, error) {
    return hex.EncodeToString(sender), nil
}
```

## Step 4: Build the custom binary

Build the custom binary. This will compile all the files in the project directory, as well as any that are imported:

```shell
go build . -o my-custom-cmd
```

This will create a binary called `my-custom-cmd` in the root of the project directory. The binary has 2 subcommands:
- `node`: Start a Kwil node, equivalent to a standalone [`kwild`](/docs/node/quickstart) binary.
- `client`: A client to interact with the Kwil node, equivalent to a standalone [`kwil-cli`](/docs/kwil-cli/installation) binary.


## Step 5: Run Postgres

Before running the custom node, you will have to start Postgres. The Kwil team has provided a default image
with the necessary configurations. For more information on how to configure your own Postgres database, please
refer to the [Postgres setup guide](/docs/daemon/installation#postgresql).

```shell
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name kwil-postgres -e "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust" \
    kwildb/postgres:latest
```

## Step 6: Run the custom `my-custom-cmd node` binary

After running Postgres, you can run the custom `my-custom-cmd node` command. The `--autogen` flag will automatically generate a new node key,
a network genesis file, and a default node configuration:

```shell
./my-custom-cmd node --autogen
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, you built a custom Kwil binary with extensions.
You can now use the custom binary to run a Kwil node with your custom extension(s).
For more information on how to implement custom extensions, please refer to the respective extension documentation.
