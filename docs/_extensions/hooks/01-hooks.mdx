description: Hook extensions for Kwil
slug: /extensions/hooks/overview
---

Hooks allow developers to extend Kwil with custom logic that is executed at specific points in the network's lifecycle. Hooks can be used to create
new network rules, add periodic tasks, or perform any other custom logic that is not provided by the default Kwil implementation. **All hooks must be
deterministic**.

## Types of Hooks

There are currently two types of hooks that can be implemented in Kwil:

### Genesis Hooks

Genesis Hooks are functions that are called exactly once, at the end of a network's genesis block (the first block). Genesis hooks are primarily used to
create initial network state, such as deploying a network-level Kuneiform schema that can be accessed by all other users.

```go
// GenesisHook is a function that is run exactly once, at network genesis.
// It can be used to create initial state or perform other setup tasks.
// If it returns an error, the network will immediately halt. Any state
// changed or error returned should be deterministic, as all nodes will
// run the same GenesisHooks in the same order.
type GenesisHook func(ctx context.Context, app *common.App, chain *common.ChainContext) error
```

### End Block Hooks

End Block Hooks are functions that are called at the end of every block. End block hooks are primarily used to perform periodic tasks, such as updating
network state, sending notifications, caching, or other tasks that need to be performed at regular intervals.

```go
// EndBlockHook is a function that is run at the end of each block, after
// all of the transactions in the block have been processed, but before the
// any state has been committed. It is meant to be used to alter state, send
// data to external services, or perform cleanup tasks for other extensions.
// An error returned will halt the local node. All state changes and errors
// should be deterministic, as all nodes will run the same EndBlockHooks in
// the same order.
type EndBlockHook func(ctx context.Context, app *common.App, block *common.BlockContext) error
```
