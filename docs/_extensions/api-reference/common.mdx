The following can be found in package `github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/common`.

## Service

```go
import (
	"github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/core/log"
)

// Service provides access to general application information to
// extensions.
type Service struct {
	// Logger is a logger for the application
	Logger log.SugaredLogger
	// ExtensionConfigs is a map of the nodes extensions and local
	// configurations.
	// It maps: extension_name -> config_key -> config_value
	ExtensionConfigs map[string]map[string]string
}
```

## App

```go
import (
	sql "github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/common/sql"
)

// App is an application that can modify and query the local database
// instance.
type App struct {
	// Service is the base application
	Service *Service
	// DB is a connection to the underlying Postgres database
	DB sql.DB
	// Engine is the underlying KwilDB engine, capable of storing and
	// executing against
	// Kuneiform schemas
	Engine Engine
}
```

## Engine
    
```go
import (
	"context"

	sql "github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/common/sql"
	"github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/core/types"
)

// Engine is an interface for the main database engine that is responsible for deploying
// and executing Kuneiform datasets.
type Engine interface {
	SchemaGetter
	// CreateDataset deploys a new dataset from a schema.
	// The dataset will be owned by the caller.
	CreateDataset(ctx *TxContext, tx sql.DB, schema *types.Schema) error
	// DeleteDataset deletes a dataset.
	// The caller must be the owner of the dataset.
	DeleteDataset(ctx *TxContext, tx sql.DB, dbid string) error
	// Procedure executes a procedure in a dataset. It can be given
	// either a readwrite or readonly database transaction. If it is
	// given a read-only transaction, it will not be able to execute
	// any procedures that are not `view`.
	Procedure(ctx *TxContext, tx sql.DB, options *ExecutionData) (*sql.ResultSet, error)
	// ListDatasets returns a list of all datasets on the network.
	ListDatasets(caller []byte) ([]*types.DatasetIdentifier, error)
	// Execute executes a SQL statement on a dataset.
	// It uses Kwil's SQL dialect.
	Execute(ctx *TxContext, tx sql.DB, dbid, query string, values map[string]any) (*sql.ResultSet, error)
	// Reload reloads the engine with the latest db state
	Reload(ctx context.Context, tx sql.Executor) error
}

// SchemaGetter is an interface for getting the schema of a dataset.
type SchemaGetter interface {
	// GetSchema returns the schema of a dataset.
	// It will return an error if the dataset does not exist.
	GetSchema(dbid string) (*types.Schema, error)
}
```

## ExecutionData

```go
// ExecutionOptions is contextual data that is passed to a procedure
// during call / execution. It is scoped to the lifetime of a single
// execution.
type ExecutionData struct {
	//TxCtx *TxContext
	// Dataset is the DBID of the dataset that was called.
	// Even if a procedure in another dataset is called, this will
	// always be the original dataset.
	Dataset string

	// Procedure is the original procedure that was called.
	// Even if a nested procedure is called, this will always be the
	// original procedure.
	Procedure string

	// Args are the arguments that were passed to the procedure.
	// Currently these are all string or untyped nil values.
	Args []any
}
```

## TxContext

```go
// TxContext is contextual information provided to a transaction execution Route
// handler. This is defined in common as it is used by both the internal txapp
// router and extension implementations in extensions/consensus.
type TxContext struct {
	Ctx context.Context
	// BlockContext is the context of the current block.
	BlockContext *BlockContext
	// TxID is the ID of the current transaction.
	TxID string
	// Signer is the public key of the transaction signer.
	Signer []byte
	// Caller is the string identifier of the transaction signer.
	// It is derived from the signer's registered authenticator.
	Caller string
	// Authenticator is the authenticator used to sign the transaction.
	Authenticator string
}
```

## BlockContext

```go
// BlockContext provides context for all block operations.
type BlockContext struct {
	// ChainContext contains information about the chain.
	ChainContext *ChainContext
	// Height gets the height of the current block.
	Height int64
	// Timestamp is a timestamp of the current block.
	// It is set by the block proposer, and therefore may not be accurate.
	// It should not be used for time-sensitive operations where incorrect
	// timestamps could result in security vulnerabilities.
	Timestamp int64
	// Proposer gets the proposer public key of the current block.
	Proposer []byte
}
```

## ChainContext

```go
// ChainContext provides context for all chain operations.
// Fields in ChainContext should never be mutated, except
// NetworkParameters can be deterministically mutated as part
// of block execution.
type ChainContext struct {
	// ChainID is the unique identifier for the chain.
	ChainID string

	// NetworkParams holds network level parameters that can be evolved
	// over the lifetime of a network.
	NetworkParameters *NetworkParameters

	// MigrationParams holds the context for all migration operations such as
	// block info to poll for the changesets from the old chain during migration.
	MigrationParams *MigrationContext
}
```

## NetworkParameters

```go
// NetworkParameters are network level configurations that can be
// evolved over the lifetime of a network.
type NetworkParameters struct {
	// MaxBlockSize is the maximum size of a block in bytes.
	MaxBlockSize int64
	// JoinExpiry is the number of blocks after which the validators
	// join request expires if not approved.
	JoinExpiry int64
	// VoteExpiry is the default number of blocks after which the validators
	// vote expires if not approved.
	VoteExpiry int64
	// DisabledGasCosts dictates whether gas costs are disabled.
	DisabledGasCosts bool

	// MigrationStatus determines the status of the migration.
	// It can be one of the following:
	// - NoActiveMigration: No active migration is in progress.
	// - MigrationNotStarted: A migration has been approved but not yet activated.
	// - MigrationInProgress: A migration is in progress.
	// - MigrationCompleted: A migration has been completed.
	MigrationStatus types.MigrationStatus

	// MaxVotesPerTx is the maximum number of votes that can be included in a
	// single transaction.
	MaxVotesPerTx int64
}
```

## MigrationContext

```go
// MigrationContext provides context for all migration operations.
// Fields in MigrationContext should never be mutated till the migration is completed.
type MigrationContext struct {
	// StartHeight is the height of the first block to start migration.
	StartHeight int64
	// EndHeight is the height of the last block to end migration.
	EndHeight int64
}
