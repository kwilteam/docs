Kwil features an extensions system that enables developers to run arbitrary applications alongside their database.  This allows developers to build
business logic, access control, and value accrual mechanisms directly into their decentralized database.

:::info
Extensions are currently in alpha, and are subject to change.  **We are actively looking for feedback on the extensions system.**

## Getting Started

To get started using extensions, check out one of the following resources:

- [Step-by-step on building and running extensions](./guide.mdx)
- [Building extensions in TypeScript](./packages/javascript.mdx)
- [Calling extensions in Kuneiform](./kuneiform.mdx)

## What are extensions for?

Extensions were designed to allow developers to utilize arbitrary logic in their databases.  Unlike traditional databases, there is often a need to directly
couple certain logic to data when using a decentralized database (e.g. token gating).  Due to the nature of decentralized networks, it is often difficult to
enforce these restrictions at a separate layer.  With extensions, developers are able to directly tie their logic and data, deploying them as one single protocol.

### Examples

1. **Token Gating** - Developers can token gate access to federated Kwil databases using extensions.  This can be done by building an extension to read data from another
blockchain before a SELECT statement is processed.

2. **Access Control** - Developers can build access control measures that utilize external systems to authenticate users.  This can be done by building an extension
that reads data from an external system before some action is performed.

3. **Stateless Functions** - Developers can build stateless functions that can be called from within a Kwil database.  This can be done by building an extension
containing the desired functionality, and calling that from within a Kwil database.
