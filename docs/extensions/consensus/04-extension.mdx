:::caution
The coordinated upgrade system and hardfork definitions defined here are
**experimental**. The system is likely to change in the future as use cases are
evaluated.
:::

### Defining the Changes

A set of well-defined changes may be specified using `kwild`'s extension system,
which allows network operators to customize a network without forking or
modifying the `kwild` source. The `extensions/consensus.Hardfork` Go structure
is used to define several well-defined types of changes that are exposed by its
fields. See the
[godocs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/extensions/consensus)
for reference.

The set of functionality changes currently possible with the extension system are:

- New _transaction payloads_ to recognize. Specifically, defining a new
  `core/types/transactions.Payload` and `PayloadType` that should be recognized.
- Updates to registered _authenticators_.  These are
  `core/crypto/auth.Authenticator` types that perform signature verification and
  identification with certain key types such as secp256k1.
- Updates to the _resolutions_ that drive governance-based transactions.
  These specify `extensions/resolutions.ResolutionConfig` instances to add or
  update, and named resolution types to remove.
- New _serialization schema_ (codecs) for transaction payloads. e.g. Borsch
  instead of RLP. This is a list of new `core/types/serialize.Codec` instances
  to enable.

In addition to the above changes to pluggable functionality updates, which are
persistent after activation, the following occur only at the activation height:

- Parameter changes to return to the consensus engine (CometBFT) when finalizing
  the block at the activation height. For example, block size or application
  version. Changes to Kwil-specific parameters such as vote expiry may also be
  specified. This is an instance of `extensions/consensus.ParamUpdates`.
- One time arbitrary alterations to application state. This is exposed in case
  there are state changes that must be done in concert with the other rules
  changes. For example, corrective actions or preparation for new functionality.

### Building `kwild` with Customizations

Refer to the [extension documents](/docs/extensions/building-kwild-with-extensions)
for creating a customized build of `kwild`. The process is the same, but with an
`init()` function calling `consensus.RegisterHardfork` with the definition established
as per the previous section. See [test node](https://github.com/jchappelow/kwil-db/blob/0affbcc0d9387f617515d69ce01ef4550e5d4777/test/nodes/fork/gremlin.go#L20)
for an example.
