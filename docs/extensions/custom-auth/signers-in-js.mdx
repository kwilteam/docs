Similar to how the Kwil node can be configured with custom signature verification, the `kwil-js` client library can be configured with custom signers.
This allows you to support crypto wallets beyond the default ones supported by `kwil-js`.

## KwilSigner Class

The JS SDK provides a `KwilSigner` class that can be used to sign transactions with custom signers. The `KwilSigner` class is a wrapper
around a signer function that takes a message and returns a signature. It can be passed to any API that requires a signer.

```typescript 
class KwilSigner {
    constructor(
        signer: (msg: Uint8Array) => Promise<Uint8Array>,
        identifier: HexString | Uint8Array,
        signatureType: SignatureType
    )
}
```

- `signer` is a callback function that takes a message and returns a signature.
- `publicKey` is the public key of the signer. It can be passed as a hex string or a Uint8Array.
- `signatureType` is the name of the signature extension. This is the `name` that is passed to the [`RegisterExtension`](/docs/extensions/authenticators#register) function in the extension.

The `KwilSigner` class can be passed to any API that requires a signer. For example, it can be passed to the `execute` function of the `WebKwil` class:

```typescript
import { KwilSigner } from '@kwilteam/kwil-js';
import { WebKwil } from '@kwilteam/kwil-js';

const customSigner = new KwilSigner(/* signer config */);
const kwil = new WebKwil(/* kwil config */);

kwil.execute(/* transaction */, customSigner);
```
