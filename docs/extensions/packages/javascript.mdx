Kwil offers an easy-to-use SDK for building extensions in JavaScript or TypeScript. The SDK assists and streamlines creating gRPC servers to connect with the Kwil Daemon.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @kwil/extensions
```

## Creating Extension

### Building Extensions

The SDK provides an `ExtensionBuilder` class that can be used to configure and build an extension. When building an extension, you must include a name and an object with the methods that can be called in the extension. You optionally can include a initializer function, custom logger function, and a port to run the extension server on.

Below are the full list of methods that on the ExtensionBuilder class:

`named(string)`: This method specifies the name of the extension. Extension names must be a single word or separated by an underscore.

`withInitializer(initializeFunction)`: This optional method takes a function that will be called each time a Kuneiform schema referencing the extension is deployed. It is usually used to set metadata for the extension methods to reference.

`withMethods(Record<string, methodFunction>)`: This is method specifices the methods that can be executed by the extension. Each method name is associated with a function that executed the method. **Method names are case insensitive.**

`withLoggerFunction(loggerFunction)`: This optional method allows you to consume logs from the server. If not specified, logs will be sent to the console.

`withPort(port)`: This optional method allows you to specify the port that the extension server will run on. If not specified, the extension will run on port 50051.

`build()`: This method builds the extension and returns an object with the `stop()` method.

`stop()`: This method gracefully stops the extension server.

### Initialize function

An initialize function is a function that is a function that allows you to set metadata for the extension. This is useful if you want to allow the database deployer to specify a variable that can be used in the extension methods (such as a smart contract address).

The initialize function is called each time a database that uses the extension is deployed. This allows you to have separate instances of an extension for each database.

The initialize function receives a map of strings from the client. The initialize function can modify the passed in map before returning a map of strings to be referenced in the extension methods.

Below is an example of an initialize function that sets a variable called `round` to `up` if metadata is not provided:

```typescript
async function initialize(metadata: Record<string, string>): Promise<Record<string, string>> {
    if (!metadata['round']) {
        metadata['round'] = 'up';
    }

    if (metadata['round']!== 'up'  || metadata['round'] !== 'down') {
        throw new Error('round must be either up or down');
    }

    return metadata;
}
```

### Extension Methods

Extension methods are functions that can be called from within Kuneiform. All extension methods receive an object with a `metadata` and `inputs` property. The `metadata` property is a map of strings that can be set by the initialize function. The `inputs` property is a map of strings that are passed in from the Kuneiform script.

Note that inputs are received as an array of Buffers, so you must convert them to a string or number with .toString() or .toNumber().

Extension methods must return a string, number, or an array of strings and numbers.

Below is an example of an extension method that divdes two inputs, and rounds based on the metadata received:

```typescript
const divide: MethodFn = async ({ metadata, inputs }) => {
    const x = inputs[0]?.toNumber();
    const y = inputs[1]?.toNumber();

    if(metadata['round'] === 'up') {
        return Math.ceil(x / y);
    } else {
        return Math.floor(x / y);
    }
}
```

### Logger Function

A logger function consumes all logs emitted from the server. If not specificed, the logs will be sent to the console.

Below is an example of a logger function that sends logs to a file:

```typescript
const logger: logFn = (log: string) => {
    fs.appendFileSync('logs.txt', log);
}
```

### Example of Building an Extenstion

Below is an example of how to build a fully functional extension called `math` that provides a method called `divide` that divides two numbers:

```typescript
import { ExtensionBuilder, MethodFn, InitializeFn, logFn } from "@kwil/extensions";
import * as fs from 'fs';

const initialize: InitializeFn = async (metadata: Record<string, string>): Promise<Record<string, string>> => {
    if (!metadata['round']) {
        metadata['round'] = 'up';
    }

    if (metadata['round']!== 'up' && metadata['round'] !== 'down') {
        throw new Error('round must be either up or down');
    }

    return metadata;
}

const divide: MethodFn = async ({ metadata, inputs }) => {
    const x = inputs[0]?.toNumber();
    const y = inputs[1]?.toNumber();

    if(metadata['round'] === 'up') {
        return Math.ceil(x / y);
    } else {
        return Math.floor(x / y);
    }
}

const logger: logFn = (log: string) => {
    fs.appendFileSync('logs.txt', log);
}

function startServer(): void {
    const server = new ExtensionBuilder()
        .named('math')
        .withInitializer(initialize)
        .withMethods({
            divide
        })
        .withLoggerFn(logger)
        .port('50051')
        .build();

    process.on('SIGINT', () => {
        server.stop();
    });

    process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
        server.stop();
    });
}

startServer();
```

### Using the Extension

To import the extension in Kuneiform, call at the top of the file:

```typescript
use math {
    round: "up"
} as math_extension;
```

To use the `math` extension in an action, call the extension name and method, and assign the result to a variable:

:::tip

Remember, all variables defined in Kuneiform must be prefixed with a `$`!

:::

```typescript
action divide_records ($val1, $val2) public {
    $result = math_extension.divide($val1, $val2);
    //rest of action
}
```
