description: "Create a resolution that credits a Kwil account with the chain's native gas token."
slug: /extensions/oracle-example-part-1
---

In this tutorial, we will create a resolution that can credit accounts with the networks native gas token. This example is based off of the
`credit_account` resolution found in the [default Kwil implementation](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/tree/v0.7.1/extensions/resolutions/credit/credit.go). It is purely for example purposes, since the default implementation
is already available in the Kwil network.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that the user is familiar with the following concepts:
- [Building a custom Kwil node with extensions](/docs/extensions/building-kwild-with-extensions)
- [Running a Kwil node locally](/docs/node/quickstart#single-node)

## Step 1. Credit Struct

We will first define a struct to hold the information about our credit. This struct will be deterministically serializable, allowing it to be
passed to stored in Kwil's resolution store. We will use Kwil's `serialize` package, which implements a deterministic and compact serialization
format based on Ethereum's RLP encoding.

Create a new directory in the `kwil-db/extensions` directory called `resolution_credit`, and create a new file called `credit_resolution.go`.

```go title="credit_resolution.go"
package main

import (
	"math/big"
)

// AccountCreditResolution is a resolution that allows accounts to be credited with a given amount.
// It is used by both the credit_account resolution and the eth_deposit_oracle.
// It can be serialized and deserialized to be passed around the network.
// The amount cannot be negative, as this will fail RLP encoding.
type AccountCreditResolution struct {
	// Account is the account to be credited.
	// This can be an Ethereum address (decoded from hex), a validator ed25519 public key,
	// or any other custom account identifier implemented in an auth extension.
	Account []byte
	// Amount is the amount to be credited to the account.
	// It uses a big.Int to allow for arbitrary precision, and to allow for uint256 values,
	// which are commonly used in token contracts on Ethereum.
	Amount *big.Int
	// TxHash is the hash of the Ethereum transaction that emitted the EVM event to credit the account.
	// This ensures that, even if the same account is credited the same amount multiple times,
	// that each credit resolution is unique. It is critical that all resolutions in Kwil are
	// unique, as they are idempotent for the lifetime of the entire network.
	TxHash []byte
}

// MarshalBinary marshals the AccountCreditResolution to binary.
// We do not use the popular json.Marshal library because we need this serialization
// to be deterministic. Kwil contains a serialization library that uses Ethereum's
// RLP encoding, which is deterministic and used for all serialization in Kwil.
func (a *AccountCreditResolution) MarshalBinary() ([]byte, error) {
	return serialize.Encode(a)
}

// UnmarshalBinary unmarshals the AccountCreditResolution from binary.
// It is the inverse of MarshalBinary, and uses the same serialization library.
func (a *AccountCreditResolution) UnmarshalBinary(data []byte) error {
	return serialize.DecodeInto(data, a)
}
```

## Step 2. Resolution Config

We will now define the configuration for our resolution. This informs the Kwil network about the rules for our resolution, and
how it should be processed. We will register this resolution using Golang's `init` function. This is a special function called by
Golang when the package is imported, and will run before any other code. This allows our `kwild` node to access the resolution
config when it starts up.

```go title="credit_resolution.go"
package main

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"math/big"

	"github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/common"
	"github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/common/functions"
	"github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/core/types/serialize"
	"github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/extensions/resolutions"
)

const CreditAccountEventType = "credit_eth_account"

// use golang's init function, which runs before main, to register the extension
// see more here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-init-in-go
func init() {
	// calling RegisterResolution will make the resolution available on startup
	err := resolutions.RegisterResolution(CreditAccountEventType, resolutionConfig)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}

// resolutionConfig defines the rules for the credit_account resolution.
var resolutionConfig = resolutions.ResolutionConfig{
	// Setting the refund resolution to 1/3 will refund all validators who spent gas voting on
	// the resolution if the resolution does not pass, but receives at least 1/3 of the total
	// network voting power. This is useful for accounting for soft forks on chains like Ethereum;
	// if 1/3 of the Kwil validators vote on a resolution due to data in a soft fork, they can
	// still get refunded. This does not cover all edge cases, but helps to minimize the risk of
	// validators losing money when acting in good faith.
	RefundThreshold: big.NewRat(1, 3),
	// Setting the confirmation threshold to 2/3 will require 2/3 of the total network voting
	// power to vote on the resolution in order for it to pass. If 2/3 of the network votes on
	// a resolution of this type, then it will be applied. If less than 2/3 of the network votes
	// have voted on this resolution by expiration, the resolution will fail.
	ConfirmationThreshold: big.NewRat(2, 3),
	// Setting the expiration height to 600 gives the validators approximately 1 hour to vote
	// on the resolution after it has been created (assuming 6s block times). If the resolution
	// has not received enough votes by the expiration height, it will fail.
	ExpirationPeriod: 600,
	// ResolveFunc defines what will happen if the resolution is approved by the network.
	// For the credit account oracle, we will credit the account with the given amount.
	// The amount cannot be negative.
	ResolveFunc: func(ctx context.Context, app *common.App, resolution *resolutions.Resolution) error {
		// Unmarshal the resolution payload into an AccountCreditResolution
		var credit AccountCreditResolution
		err := credit.UnmarshalBinary(resolution.Body)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}

		if credit.Amount.Sign() < 0 {
			return errors.New("credit amount cannot be negative")
		}

		// Credit the account with the given amount
		return functions.Accounts.Credit(ctx, app.DB, credit.Account, credit.Amount)
	},
}
```

## Step 3. Register the Resolution

The last step is to register the resolution extension with the Kwil node. This is done by calling the `RegisterResolution` function in the package's `init` function.

```go title="credit_resolution.go"
package main

import (
	"github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/extensions/resolutions"
)

const CreditAccountEventType = "credit_account"

func init() {
	// calling RegisterResolution will make the resolution available on startup
	err := resolutions.RegisterResolution(CreditAccountEventType, resolutionConfig)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

## Next Steps

This example is a resolution that can be called by an oracle. To see how to create an oracle that can call this resolution, see the [oracle example part 2](/docs/extensions/oracle-example-part-2).
