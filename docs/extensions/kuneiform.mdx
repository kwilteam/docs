To use an extension in Kuneiform, the Kwil network you are using must be running the extension.  To learn how to run your own extension,
see the [Extensions section of the daemon documentation](../daemon/extensions.mdx).

## Example

As an example, we will be referring to a hypothetical ERC20 extension on this page. This extensions only function is to
read token balances for some ERC20 smart contract on Ethereum.  It has one function, `balanceOf(address)`, which returns
the balance of the given address.

## Importing The Extension

To import an extension in a Kuneiform schema, you need to use its declared name.  With this, you can pass any initialization values, as well
as an alias for this instance of the extension.

```typescript
use erc20 {
    contract_address: "0x1234..."
} as my_token;
```

The same extension can be imported several times:

```typescript
use erc20 {
    contract_address: "0x1234..."
} as my_token;

use erc20 {
    contract_address: "0x5678..."
} as my_other_token;
```

## Calling Methods

To call a method on an extension, you need to use the alias you gave it when importing it.  You can then call the method
you want to use, and pass any arguments it requires:

```typescript

action use_caller_balance () public {
    $balance = my_token.balanceOf(@caller);
    // rest of the action...
}
```

The above action will call the `balanceOf` method on the `my_token` extension, passing the address of the caller as the
first argument.  The result of this call will be stored in the `$balance` variable, and can be used in the rest of the
action.


## Full Schema

Below is a full example of a Kuneiform schema that uses the above hypothetical ERC20 extension to gate users reading from the `nft` table based
on their cumulative USDC and DAI balances:

```typescript
database kwil_erc20;

use erc20 {
    contract_address: "0x1234..."
} as usdc_token;

use erc20 {
    contract_address: "0x5678..."
} as dai_token;

table nft {
    id int primary,
    owner_address string,
    token_id int,
    token_address string
}

action read_nft() public {
    $usdc_balance = usdc_token.balanceOf(@caller);
    $dai_balance = dai_token.balanceOf(@caller);

    SELECT CASE WHEN $usdc_balance + $dai_balance < 100
    THEN ERROR('caller does not have enough balance') END;

    SELECT * FROM nft;
}
```
