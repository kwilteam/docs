Kwil provides a testing framework for users to test their applications. This can be used
to test SQL queries, procedure logic, and precompiles. There are two ways to run the tests:
using `kwil-cli`, or using the Kwil testing SDK.

**CLI Tests**

`kwil-cli` tests are generally easier to write. Users can specify test cases in
JSON, and run the tests using the `kwil-cli utils test` command. `kwil-cli` tests are useful
for users who want to test certain procedure logic / SQL queries, or test foreign procedures
calling several schemas. They are _not_ capable of testing precompiles.

**Go SDK Tests**

SDK tests can be more cumbersome to write, but allow for more flexibility and can test more
features. They use the Go testing SDK, and therefore the tests themselves must be written in Go.
While SDK tests can do everything a `kwil-cli` test can do, they can also be used to:

- simulate multiple users using an application
- make multiple consecutive procedure/action calls across one or more schemas
- test extensions such as precompiles and resolutions

To get started, see the guides for either the [`kwil-cli` tests](/docs/kuneiform/testing/kwil-cli) or the
[Go SDK tests](/docs/kuneiform/testing/go-sdk).
